     There are a few small bugs here and there and it is not too difficiult to learn how to play. Just don't jump in on Prince and for Cage's sake DON'T LISTEN TO THE ADVISORS!!! Look up guides on the internet if you really need to. 
 
    I suggest for you to wait until the Winter or Fall sale to get the game because it is a few years old and the new Civ game drops in October, however, it will most likely be riddled with bugs just as this was after it's release. When buying this game make sure you get all of the DLC so you can play the game correctly. If you try to play this game in Vanilla you will not only be playing a broken game and you will be missing out on the amazing content in Gods and Kings and Brave New World.

Those people who complain are angry because the world has to be explored thoroughly or simply cannot read their stats.

If you do not have the according armor and weapon rating for the enemy or for the area you are in you should ignore it.

Here is a little tip. Talk to NPCs to find important areas, items, artifacts, etc. and avoid areas that are not suited for your equipment:
White/1 star= weakest
Green/2 stars= second weakest
Blue/3 stars= middle
Purple/4 stars= second strongest
Yellow (or gold)/5stars= strongest

Work your way up slowly in each region. You just need to invest some time.
I have had a great time during Alpha and that the EXP is gone is sad but that system isn't necessary to have fun.

Promises were broken and the game is basically abandoned by the devs. It had so much promise, but alas, it just wasn't meant to be.





The hate on this is extremely odd to me. Sure on release it only has 3 armies. If your only looking at numbers your gonna have a bad time. Devs want to add ""all races"" from 40k lore given time, and if they are as fleshed out as they are now I cannot wait. With new races comes new multiplayer modes because thats just how they set that up. I have about 12 hours into this game at the time of this review and it is all campaign. Skulls are so thrown around in campaign that i have over 1000 skulls without playing a single multiplayer game and unlocking atleast 3 or 4 heroes to play in campaign cuz i didnt want striking scorpions or whatever. The game is a very refreshing breath to the RTS genre. While i see the comparison to a MOBA I can tell you from having hours into the Beta that it is not. A Moba implies you level up your hero in the arena and get equipment while in the field and whatever. This you do not. Only benefit of leveling up your hero in any mode is more skins and fancy circle under their feet OOOOOO! Play through the campaign and your heroes will atleast be lvl 7 or 8. Unlocked Terminator cuz i didnt want Jonah and it was lvl 4 or 5 by end of 1 yes 1 mission. 
some pros
-Story seems to take quite awhile. Each mission takes me about an hour on Normal but that might just be i like to crush enemies
-All races play vastly different from their DOW1 and DOW2 counterparts. 
-With Devs wanting to add all races from 40k lore and with the polish and uniqueness each races brings now its hard not to get excited
-guaranteed to have new modes as thats how their menu is set up. whether its last stand or annihilation time will tell
-price tag is normal. most sites have for around $45 or less
-if you don't like amount of races at launch guaranteed in a year or two pick up Grand Master version
-some missions have you get very familiar with the race your using, down to what their buildings do.
Cons
-campaign jumping from Races is very daunting at times, goign from space marine to Ork is less jarring than going Ork to Eldar to Ork
-out of the 12 missions ive played 1 was very annoying and if you played the campaign you probably will already know which Eldar one im talking about.
-Interesting story, but kinda cliche
Neither Pro nor Con depends on person
-base building is minimal. Like in DOW 2 you build your buildings to get more units. The difference is there is more buildings to choose. Instead of upgrading your units by clicking on the singular squads you build a building to upgrade all squads, some squads however still have to be clicked singular i.e. tactical squad to get flamers or lascannon
-resource points are still a thing if you didnt like from first game you wont like now.
-Multiplayer Power Core mode just feels like your smacking a big base with the Core being the HQ
So in closing, multiplayer isnt bad if you think of it like a true RTS where turrets are there as base defense and the Core is the HQ you have to destroy to win. the ""power generators"" are so easy to take down i dont even know why they have them. If after reading this your still undecided know that I havent touched skirmish or multiplayer since Open Beta, all my hours are from campaign(about 12 at time of review) and i could easily get more hours farming skulls to unlock and playing multiplayer matches. I paid $45 for this game and if I can get 45 hours out of it(which i very easily could) my money is considered worth the investment.",1493824149,1593114753,False,0,0,0.473827064037323,0,False,False,False,76561198045485800,238,3,1054,0,1054,1494079701
2672673,504230,Celeste,62117539,english,"I wanted to like Celeste. Really, I did!

And in many ways, the game delivered on many things that I heard. The story was well told, and Madeline is a great protagonist. Seeing her tale unfold as both she and Badeline developed through the story was intriguing. The dialogue can strike a consistent nail on being both serious, funny, or both simultaneously. Theo is great fun, and the other characters are well-written. The soundtrack is great as well, and if for nothing else, I pushed for that.

This all falls apart when, at least for me, the gameplay doesn't hold up. As someone with Super Meat Boy, Cave Story, the four Shovel Knight campaigns, VVVVVV, ect. under their belt, all games I love, Celeste just... doesn't hold up with these titles. Allow me to explain.

If I had to take a shot at what I disliked about this game's gameplay, I would probably say 'the dash'. The climbing mechanic is cumbersome at times, and I've died plenty when I thought I was holding the climb button when my finger twitched, but I had a lot more frustration with the dash. I don't even think it's the dash itself, more the fact that the 8 directions it fires off in feel extremely inconsistent to land. Retracting my first statement, I don't think it's even the dash primarily. Several other features fall to this as well, like the bubble apparatus in [spoiler] Golden Ridge [/spoiler] and [spoiler] Mirror Temple [/spoiler], where you have to aim in 8 directions. Very often did I find myself going diagonally up when I want to go straight forward, or vice versa when I actually needed a diagonal dash.

This is my biggest complaint with the game. The rest of it honestly did go smoothly. As I said, I loved the story and the soundtrack, but ultimately, they're vices to the gameplay. And loathe I am to say it, Celeste unfortunately fails to deliver on the most critical aspect of a brutal platformer like this - the ability to always know that your movement is precise.",1579489110,1580094947,False,4,1,0.49211710691452,3,True,False,False,76561198208339800,105,21,1031,0,390,1580175495

I got it for ~10 bucks on sale. The value is immense. The game is very fun and very satisfying and very deep strategy wise.

You have to realise getting into this, that what you have before you is a movie interrupted by mediocre gameplay. The gameplay will not keep you entertained for 30 hours. Even though the game interrupts you with notification spam all the time, even though the movement is janky and buggy and frustrating, especially with offroad vehicles, even though there is all this repetetive ridiculously annoying handholding, frustrating enemies, horrible savepoints, and even though the game loves to make you click through menus - 12 clicks for every mission you want to turn in, I enjoyed the first 10 hours or so. But the other 20 were a total and absolute slog. I thought about just watching the rest on youtube many times. There are uneccessarily many missions in the game, and the gameplay just isn't interesting enough for that. Trust me, once you get past the half way point, you want to just get it done. And. it. just. doesn't. end.

In case you don't know anything about the game, and without spoilers: this is quite literally a walking simulator. There are enemies, there is shooting, but it is not very engaging. You will walk, a lot. There are things making walking more interesting, but not for 30 hours.

So then why do I recommend this? Because, as a movie, this game is great. The world is amazing, unique, and something never seen before. The cutscenes are the absolute best I have ever seen in my 26 years of gaming. I believe they were all acted out, by the actual actors, probably with really good facial mocap because the lipsync is flawless. The details and acting in every scene are putting many actual movies to shame. There is just so much going on in the background of every scene, so many little things that all tell a story in of itself. It is one of those movies, where every frame could be a painting. The story is just weird but engaging and definitely something you have never experienced before. I am over 30, I have seen many movies, read many books, played many games. Usually, I know where a story is going from the start. But not here. This is actually so well written or just plain weird that it had me staring in bewilderment at the screen many times.

So there you are. If you are expecting engaging gameplay, cool action, etc. Stay away. If you like weird movies, go for it. I would say this: don't do side missions. Save up your enjoyment of the gameplay to get you as far through the game as possible.",1607211153,1607211153,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198011351900,546,18,2215,0,2215,1607209212

5463160,782330,DOOM Eternal,65375171,english,"This game has the same faults Doom 2016 had but amplified. 

First of all the sound mixing sucks. People might think this is a nitpick but sound is critical in a game where the entire premise revolves around shooting. Gunshots lack punch and the spatial audio is still terrible. The weapon sounds give the impression you are shooting bbs at your enemies. Go play Insurgency Sandstorm, MW19, Squad or practically any other game then come back to this. You will be amazed at how bad the sound mixing is. Hell, even the original two Doom games had better gun sounds.

The gibbing and weapon feedback feels terrible. Enemies just turn into weightless mush after you shoot them only to disappear moments later. I just don't feel the impact of the guns. Something about the enemy animation is way too floaty. The lack of feedback and weak audio completely ruins the experience and leaves me feeling completely disconnected from the carnage. That's a death sentence for a Doom game!

The flashy item pickups add visual clutter, ruin the aesthetic and are annoying. They take me out of the game. I dislike the weapon upgrade system as well. I think the combat system in general is bloated and over-complicated for a Doom game. Doom has always been known to have simple combat that just worked and this isn't that.

The combat and atmosphere in this game isn't immersive. It feels cartoony, bloated, over-polished. and disconnected. The game in general lacks the visceral experience and atmosphere the previous games had. I don't feel immersed in this world at all. It feels like watered down, Disney Doom.

I can completely understand why people enjoy this game but It's just not for me. I may not have played long but I could tell what I was in for... more of the same. The same stuff I tolerated in '16 but thought they'd fix this time around. Nope.

1. In the lobby a man was spamming his mic with some ""dank memes"" like ""m'lady"" and some really messed up mlp shit
2. while in the theater the only videos that anyone would request was porn, mostly gay or some kind of shit fetish.

1. This game was made by something like 11 people who have never designed a game before.
2. They don't owe you anything.

Everyone forgets what it used to be like buying a game. You bought the game and that was it. End of story. Now you own what you bought, no more, no less. 

This game has no subscriptions, no micro-transactions, and no paid DLC, yet the devs are still providing more content and fixes!

Think about that. How many people do you know that work for free? How can you sit here and complain about a game that costs half the price of a triple A title, competes with some triple A titles, and where the devs are actually listening to the community and providing more content FOR FREE!

They are a small team of developers working on their first project and they knocked it out of the park! The game is beautiful, the music is gorgeous, and the combat is extremely rewarding. I couldn't recommend this game enough. 

It's okay to give constructive criticism, but don't listen to reviewers who complain a game doesn't get updated enough.

Day 1: Build Cabin off of edge of cliff overlooking ocean so no cannibals can sneak from behind it
- Surround the front with traps
- Try to sleep for the night, but cannibals chillin outside so can't
- Spend the night behind my cabin with a small fire (theres a little spot for my character to hide, but not enough room for the cannibals to reach me, they just fall off the cliff)

Day 2: Time to explore the beach
-Find luggage scattered down the shore, with more energy bars than I know what to do with
-Find boat, on it - flares, new axe, rope, someones mix tape and a skull
-Head back to basecamp, but on the way find some camp with triangular cabins. Creeoy music starts up so I don't hang around too long
-Actually get some decent sleep that night

Day 3: More exploring
-Decide to explore the woods some more
-Find berrys, seeds etc
-Stumble across another one of those camps, this time I look around
-Seems like the cannibals have a fetish for tennis balls since every corpse I find has about 8 shoved in them
-Find a hole leading to a cave with a rope going down, decide against it since I'm probably not ready
-Head back to camp for some sleep

Day 4: Defenses
-Decide I need better defenses around my cabin
-Build walls almost all around my cabin (this takes about the whole day)
-Sleep

Day 5: Death
-Wake up and go to finish my wall
-As I step out side my fortress to gather more logs I see a group of cannibals just walking around not far from me (about 6)
-Stay away from them but don't actually run
-As they get closer I go back into my fortress
-They don't chase me but somehow they all wandered into the one spot I hadn't set up a wall
-They want my blood now
-I hide in my cabin as they all rush to me
-5 of the 6 hit my traps
-He starts attacking, I try to swing my axe and he doesn't swing it
-I die because asshole didn't swing his axe no matter how many times I tried to get him to

4405745,227300,Euro Truck Simulator 2,29589707,english,"Beautiful, Engaging and worth buying a gamepad for...

I can't say enough good things about this game.  I was hoping this game would be something different from the usual, relaxing, engaging and beautiful and it is all that and more. I purchased the game in a sale bundle which for a bit less than retail for the core game also included for free the DLC's Going East, Scandinavia, High Value cargo and a couple other cosmetic dodads.   Probably the best value of any of the many games and bundles I've purchased on Steam. 

I'm not a hardcore gamer and I'm running this on an older MacBook (which necessitates much lower graphics settings) but playing ET2 is simply a beautiful experience.  It's like spending hours driving through European postcards and yet it provides frequent enough decisions (gas, repairs, job choice,  occasionally difficult driving situations, managing your company, etc...) that 90 hours in I still feel engaged and excited to play more. 


As for the visuals, I have to praise the designers. There's so many ways they could have done less and still had a game that was nearly as good, but it's amazing how much detail they include.  As an example, most driving games have areas with tall highway sound barriers and that's the edge of the world, but in ET2 when using the chase camera suddenly you see that on the other side of the barriers is even more of the world: forests or an industrial zone or a castle or a....  Because of this, and even though it's just s smidge more fiddly to drive, I highly recommend using the chase camera when driving during the day.  It's really ups the beauty factor. 


Lastly, if you don't have a driving rig I highly recommend a PS2 style controller or other pad with 2 joysticks.  Being able to assign one joystick to the steering and the other to provide an incrmental control for the throttle (accelleration and reverse) makes the trucks much easier to control and the game even more fun to play.  If you need one the Logitech F310 (newer version of what I have) is well rated and tends to go for $15-20 on Amazon. I assure you it will be money very well spent.",1485798887,1485799153,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198091250700,113,3,13700,0,4971,1593354356

At the beginning is may seem quick the game, but as you finish it again and again unlocking more things and donating extra gold to the shop. You will find that you are hooked at playing it. Given that there are 178 achievements, you would be busy for a while to hunt them all down!!
Grinding and grinding to unlock all the characters, all the secrets and all the endings. Easily can sink 5 hours a day into this. As you may see i have not done so with my hours on this but I sure am planing to.
All in all I found Rebirth absolutely brilliant. I recommend it to anyone. Although it can be a rage inducer at times. Beating Mum then dying to a mob, one of the most infuriating moments in a game, but alas. That happens.

479439,70,Half-Life,71975353,english,"What can I say? It's Half-Life. Almost every FPS game released after this game owes something to it.

Unlike many other historically important shooters, such as Doom or Quake, Half-Life's gameplay holds up pretty well in comparison to today's FPS fare, probably because it was so influential that other games since have simply followed its example. The gunfights are an addictive mix of frenzied improvisation and tactical planning, and the game's pacing is excellent (at least up until the unfortunate Xen chapters, which murder the pacing somewhat in its final 20% or so.)

In any case, this game is well worth the $2 it goes down to on sale. The question, then, is which version to buy; the original (as I am reviewing here), the Source port, or Black Mesa. Half-Life: Source is pretty much the same game but with the tradeoff of better box physics in exchange for more bugs and costing five times as much. Black Mesa is a totally different game, and not really my cup of tea; for my money, you should experience the original before deciding whether to try Black Mesa's reimagining.

I'd recommend this game to anyone with an interest in first-person shooters, past or present. It holds up, and for as little as it costs, you're not taking much of a risk on whether you enjoy it or not.

Falling structures, complex enemies, water sections (better than most), and other mechanics are all mixed together in the main path through the game, side areas, cartridges, and inside Stevens. By far the strongest aspect of The End Is Nigh is its challenge. Every collectible gives a valuable reward, and the game is still satisfying without the extra content. If you just want to beat the game and finish the main objective, you'll be very happy with your experience. If you want to collect every single thing in game, you'll be even happier with your experience. If you want to push yourself to your absolute limits, there are countless challenges that will make you want to pull out your hair and scream, followed by euphoria once you finally do it. The more you play the more you'll love it.",1502261973,1529109437,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198079516400,214,6,27973,0,15997,1600920652

    The game consists in a boss rush where your ennemies, against whom one mistake is fatal, all possess a weakness to which the character's single arrow is deadly. Unfortunately, this nonetheless interesting premise is ruined by a clumsy implementation. Considering how costly are errors, it is necessary for the player to feel responsible for them. However, he may find himself rather blaming the game, and rightly so, for mainly 3 reasons:
[list]
   [*]Aiming with a joystick and without an indicator or aim assist is simply frustrating. Reliably hitting targets outside of a small radius is about impossible. The difficulty of the game is tailored around this characteristic, but why handicap the player with vague aim that could be improved with a simple indicator? Also, keyboard controls are pretty much dysfunctional. I suppose all of this was designed purposefully to balance the difficulty of the one-shot mechanic, but still. 
   [*]Beating bosses requires experimenting, since the winning condition isn't always obvious, but finding answers often requires several walks back to the boss arena, which becomes a bit of an artificial grind. 
   [*]Close calls are frequent, and I felt like hitboxes were sometimes innacurate. 
[/list]
   These flaws don't impair too much the gameplay experience in normal mode since quite a bit of leeway is given, but playing in ""no roll no sprint"" mode revealed a rotten foundation. 
   Also, the pixel art is pretty ordinary, in my opinion.
   I might have been harsh in this review, but a tighter 3.5 hours of gameplay for 16.99$ isn't asking too much, especially when the harder modes aren't worth playing.",1548126290,1548127360,False,2,0,0.502009689807892,0,True,False,False,76561198258266300,326,3,295,0,295,1548121857

I don't hate the game, they would need to try to mess up borderlands gunplay and I like what they did to change some gun brands(Looking at you Hyperion, with your stupid snipers that can't hit jack in the old games) but the story is just..... painful. The writing is nothing special, a little cringe but nothing that would ruin the game, BL1 had a meh story too and it was just fine. [b] Right up until Ava is introduced. [/b] 

Ava is a little annoying but not unlikable at first, her sidequest to get her diary tells you the kinda stuff she's had to do to survive after her parents were killed and I honestly saw her as a character trying to make the best she could of her new life with Maya. However, the writing for her quickly takes a nosedive once you [spoiler] Open the vault on Promethea. [/spoiler] She almost instantly went from girl trying to make the best of her life, even if she has a little of a rebellious attitude, to a spoiled child that deserves a time out for the rest of the game and the rest of the cast just.... [b] Accepts her bratty nature without question! [/b] I don't think I need to spoiler this but just in case, [spoiler] When Maya is killed, Ava not only seems to move on frighteningly quick, but she actually goes as far to blame Lilith for it! Not to terribly long after, she gets made leader of the crimson raiders! [/spoiler] Ava could be removed from the entire game and it would be a net benefit since they don't have the story culminating with this child taking center stage among the non-player characters in the main story.

If you see this game for a price you can justify, go right ahead and buy it, but for what I got, I actually fell guilty for accepting this from a friend, even if it was half price.

2621674,541210,Cold Waters,32620588,english,"It is a really good game, and it reminds me of silent hunter. There are not so many submarine simulation game recently. So if you are a submarine game fan, and you want to enjoy some bad ass serious mordern submarine tactics and warfare, it is definitly your choice!
For the UI, it is nothing like silent hunter------it is much simpler than the silent hunter series and dangerous waters, no more dazzling buttons, no more complex TMA. In dangerous waters i need more than 20 minutes to attack an enemy vessel. However in this game you need no more than 5 minutes. Generally in this game, things and much more visualised than in Dangerous Waters. You can directly SEE whats going on(if you have enough enmey vessel information) rather than sitting in some omni-control room.
However there are still some parts i dont like. 
First, it kind of lost that feeling of silent hunter series, and I found that it is not because of different submarines. Because I want that RPG feeling from silent hunter series. In silent hunter series, I AM A CAPTAIN! I can walk in your submarine and see what my boys are doing. However, in this game, maybe I am just a artifical intelligent program? It is seems a little bit weird but i just missed the RPG feeling and career feeling from the silent hunter.
Second, it seems that the damage system is not complete. You can sink any enemy vessel with just one torpedo: no matter it is a old November class or the sea behemoth Typhoon. Even the surface ship can be dealt with one torpedo hit. Thats not realistic.
Third, the price is not satisfying, 39$.

3110498,583950,Artifact,47321692,english,"I've been enjoying the game so far. I've played enough TCG such as Pokemon, Hearthstone, Yu-gi-oh and the very recent GWENT (Witcher card game). My first impressions is that Artifact is very polished, high quality and refreshing. I know people are bashing its monetizing model, lets put that aside for now. 

Now the game itself feels like Hearthstone in many ways as are most generic TCG available these days. Obviously Hearthstone being a massive success, many other card games would borrow its concept. But Artifact adds its own twist, it has 3 lanes/ boards. A very unique winning condition, either by taking out 2 towers or focus down the ancient. Those who played Dota 2 might be able to relate! I played thousands of hours of Dota 2 back in the days. Valve converted the MOBA into a card game which is pretty sick. The fact that they kept the Heroes skills and personalities from Dota 2 and made it into Artifact gives me nostalgia, I love it!

One of the interesting mechanics that I like the most is the priority. where you get to initiate first or second. To me this is very fun and strategic, where you could bait your opponent and then counter them once they have expanded their mana. Or to strike first before they could play any cards thus render thier turn useless. While the cards itself feels very Hearthstone like, mechanics such as priority and phases resemblance Yu-gi-oh much. It has been a while since I played a TCG with such complexity. Now when I say Artifact is a complex TCG, please do not be discouraged. Yes, it is more complex than Hearthstone but less complex than Yu-gi-oh IMO. And the tutorial did a decent job of explaining ALMOST everything you need to know. 

Now the monetizing model.... it is not F2P, it has no grind, it can be placed on the market place. I reckoned is okay.... at least these cards have some value?? Unlike Hearthstone which I spent like over $800 but now it is just sitting there since I'm no longer playing. And trust me, Artifact is easier to get the cards you want compare to other TCG. I like the Keeper draft where I could pick the cards I want (sniping for rares). You can straight up buy the cards that you want in the market place, you'd be surprise the cards are relatively cheap compare to other TCGs. 

But if you don't want to spend much, there is always Phantom Draft which is the mode I like the most. You get to play cards that you do not own, so I'd say you don't even need to have a full collection. I would just do Phatom draft all day, I just want to have fun. 

I think most veteran TCG players would like this game.

2014731,381210,Dead by Daylight,44717825,english,"I've been playing Dead by Daylight for about a year and a half now and have been following it since the following months after its launch. It has been one of the few games that I consistently come back to whenever I want to play something either with friends or by myself. I've bonded and met a lot of great people either by playing this game or just by bringing it up.

I've seen this game through almost every patch, every bug, every chapter, every exploit, and will continue to do so. The game is fantastic, even though it can be very frustrating. But, so can any multiplayer game. Even with the bugs and the occasional toxic survivor or killer, you still have fun on either side of the killer's weapon.

When playing survivor, there's a variety of ways to play it while still achieving the main objective: do the gens, get the doors open, and escape. You can play altruistically and save your fellow survivors, take hits, be a distraction after you save someone from their final hook. You can be objective focused, work generators and work on the escape routes while others do the saving. Along with a lot of other builds that are possible. You can even go into a game just to loot the chests.

While playing the killer, of course your main objective is killing the survivors, but with the variety of the killers and their powers, you can control what type of game this will be. You can be a brutal chainsaw killer, trap survivors, hit them from across the map, or even hunt them down without them noticing. The perks just help with your weaknesses. Be it hunting survivors, maintaining map control, or slowing down the game. 

When it comes to current problems with this game I can name one major issue with Dead by Daylight and that is the Survivor main vs. Killer main mentality. At the end of the day, the developers do intend this game to be a killer biased game, which makes sense! But as you climb in hours and climb the ranks, the game slowly becomes even. And because of that, it causes the big discourse of ""oh you're just a survivor/killer main, you don't know what the game needs"", etc. etc. The best solution to this? Avoid these types of forums, players, or streamers. I don't mean plug your ears and sing 'lalala' anytime someone says something about balancing because there are so many good points from survivor and killer mains with thousands of hours. Like Hexy, JenDenise, Diatech (back when he used to stream it a lot more), ScottJund, and Hybrid Panda are some great examples of people who play one side more than the other and do have great opinions and ideas for balancing perks and changing up gameplay.

If you had asked me about eight or nine months ago what I had thought was the biggest problem was with this game, my immediate response would be that it feels like the developers don't listen and don't care about this game. But, it has definitely changed since then. Five months ago as of writing and posting this review, the development team posted a schedule that they are following as they continue to evolve and better Dead by Daylight. They have a better reporting system, outlining what they consider needs a permanent or temporary ban. They've added more people to their team and are taking in player feedback and feelings into consideration. It feels like they care about the game and their player base now, which is a large change from before. They stream and explain the changes and their reasoning and play test things to see if changes will be fun and fair and work with the game.

After all of this rambling, would I recommend this game? Yes. I would recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of horror, slashers, and loves to grind. I would recommend anyone who is looking to play something new or has been looking at this for a while just to try it. When you put aside the discourse of survivor vs. killer mains, the community is great and fun. It is a fantastic game, with a great concept, and it has been well done.

As good as this game might be, there is not much implemented, as of yet. I am not complaining, only suggesting things which could be added in the future:

- Wide roads for horses and carts, with stables (similar to pastures).
- Multiplayer. I'm not 100% sure how this would work but I know a lot more people would buy this if it was multiplayer enabled.
- More models for buildings other than houses.
- The ability to research or upgrade technologies.
- Walls to keep out unwanted creatures or people.
- Outwards trade or Exportation. This could be an option from the trading port, that allows us to send out a boat to trade with other towns.
- Day/Night cycle. Again, I'm not exactly sure how this would work but it would be nice to see.
- Parks or recreational areas. At the moment people seem to hang around primarily in graveyards, something like a park would be a nice way to give the citizens a place to relax.
- More indepth citizens. It would be nice if the citizens each had a sort of story that you could follow through until their final days. Also they could become friends or enemies with other people, working better with people they like.
- Advanced job assignment. There should be a way to assign a certain peson to a certain buiding of a job. For example if I wanted Bob to work as a farmer on my orchard instead of on the farm, because it was winter.

As a Mount & Blade gamer and YouTuber, I have seen games struggle in finding the correct gameplay for melee combat in order to beat the latter and come out on top and I do believe Mordhau gets really close to perfection. 

From start to finish Mordhau manages to immerse the player into a visually stunning world with intense multiplayer medieval battles.

It has some mechanics and ideas that really expand the series; Having customizable Skills and abilities that truly differ between  different characters lets those characters really shine. Two players playing as the same character can still have very different playstyles. And the differences between different guns by different manufacturers also adds some lovely variety.
But all of this means nothing when every third enemy you kill spews forth a spray of rare weapons.
Seriously, I don't even bother picking up blue or green weapons any more. You don't even need the money you'd get from selling them.
Gold quality weapons are so common and so much stronger than anything else that the entire CONCEPT of having millions of randomly generated guns is totally pointless.
The Mayhem system is a terrible idea. The devs are basically admitting that they CAN'T balance their game and are offering players a crude attempt to balance it themselves. It is an attempt to increase difficulty with blatantly arbitrary addition. Once you unlock Guardian Points, the last vestige of challenge in the game falls apart completely.
And don't bother pointing out that Mayhem and Guardian perks can be turned off: If you have to turn major aspects of a game OFF to make the game better, then it is a poorly made game.
This game is short, as linear as falling down a well, and piss-easy. It's boring to play.
The heart and soul of a good shooter is its choreography: You must carefully balance where the challenge lies, and make sure things are never too easy or too hard. Enemy placement and variety is key.
And this game falls flat in its choreography.
The writing is crap, too. Seriously, Eva is a nasty little monster who did nothing but brood and get characters we DO like killed; and we're supposed to sympathize with her?",1598140798,1598140798,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197993496000,456,91,5152,0,5152,1598069619

It has a very calming, warm spirited approach to the world in the game, and the mechanics of this game are really intruiguing and easy to delve into for the most part.

It is extremely addicting and you're likely to disappear into the game for like two weeks straight until you run out of content. (which can be overwhelming if you binge too much at once).

After that there is the multiplayer beta which just launched.
I hope the developers make similar games in the future.
I do kind of wish they would add a pace break though every once in a while, you can burn yourself out of the game with too much fast paced binging which seemed to have happened to a few of my friends. I feel like that specifically conflicts with the game's theme a tad, which is a vacation from the busy fast-paced, never ending, always demanding, work environment (Joja Mart).

3120775,583950,Artifact,47180564,english,"It's hard for me to openly and honestly recommend Artiact as it currently stands. The draft mode is probably the most compelling aspect of it, but every time I boot up the game and play a few games I end my session feeling exhausted. Not in the ""Ah that was a satisfying battle of wits way"" but more of a ""There's just a lot of information on screen"" kind of way.

I feel like many of the systems in the game aren't there for gameplay, they're there to be similar to Dota 2, and while I appreciate the efforts, they just don't work well together.

The two biggest pains points for me: Imbalance and Randomness.

Card games do not have perfectly balanced cards, it's the nature of the beast and what ends up making draft formats funs. But Artifact is different in that it has Heroes. Unlike ""bombs"" you draft in, say, Magic: The Gathering, heroes are core to your strategy in the game, and keep coming back the entire game. They sway battles just by existing, sometimes in other lanes. The difference in a good hero and a bad one is GIGANTIC, to the point where having one or two key heroes in your draft can seriously carry you hard.

Randomness is also huge in Artifact. It's built into the core game. Due to how position on units works, you have a 25% chance to attack a target to your left or right, regardless of if your lane is full or empty. This takes away from a lot of the strategy planning ahead can have in combat, but does make combat tricks feel more valuable. Either way, this on top of the three decks in your shop, on top of natural card draw, on top of cards with random effects... It just feels like too much. The series of small random chances do help shake up the game, but sometimes they throw battles into your opponents favor out of seemingly nowhere. It makes for good back and forth gameplay sometimes, but even after 15 hours I can feel it grating on me. 

Artifact is a good game for a certain kind of player, I'm on the fence on whether or not I'm that kind of player. I'm enjoying Casual Phantom Draft for now but each time I run through a draft, I just find myself not wanting to touch the game for a few days. 

Artifact might be for you, but it's certainly not for everyone.",1543471750,1543471750,False,141,3,0.688121855258942,5,False,True,False,76561198014840100,279,34,870,0,858,1543873153

1: the graphics are actually surprisingly beautiful, especially if you zoom in on the stone structures its quite easily one of the prettiest games of its kind.
2: The devs are responsive, and not robotic like some developers I've encountered in the past and I appreciate that immensely so I felt they deserved props for it.  From responding to bug reports, to being present and updating people in the community and in discord these guys really are doing a great job.  
3: The systems of the game are, while somewhat complex in some aspects they are very logical and once you get a feel for them it'll come naturally.
4: Designing your own monuments:  This I can't stress enough I love it!  This may be a bias i have because of my field of studies but the fact that I can design and watch as my churches, and monasteries are constructed truly makes me happy.  The scale of the structures too is up to you, you can pick whether or not its a huge, towering cathedral with spirals topped with crosses, or gargoyles  its really that detailed and I love it.  
5: They are updating and working on the game quite often.  The updates do legitimately fix bugs, and the changes are usually fairly noticeable.  For instance, I was experiencing a glitch on one level once I hit ~102 citizens.  I tried that, actually today on the map I'm now making my mega monastery on, and I'm sitting at 150 citizens.

1901111,381210,Dead by Daylight,61236414,english,"Before i get started: this has a good framework, and it's of an overall decent quality - good sound design, nice maps and graphics. However, it suffers A LOT from poor balancing that seems to be focused entirely on players that have all the unlocks in the game. 

If you've ever played Dota or League of Legends you should already be accustomed to this, except in DBD it's actually worse - in Dota and League of Legends, other players do not get inherent advantages over you for having played longer, besides naturally having a better understanding of the game and more experience. In DBD, playtime = unlocking actual gameplay modifiers, meaning that people that have played more than you will ALWAYS have an advantage over you that may in some cases be impossible to outplay. 

It's on the step below pay2winning - that is fortunately impossible in the game, as the only thing you can really buy is DLC characters (that DO however have their own unique abilities that are otherwise inaccessible.). If the game would've had pay2win elements, i would have had nothing but hate for it. As it is, i can respect the idea, despite the execution being extremely flawed.

For new players, Dead by Daylight is a good excuse to hang out with three friends (IF YOU VOICE CHAT), and very little else.

If you are willing to waste roughly 140 hours of your life to be given the opportunity to start playing Dead by Daylight FOR REAL, then you should give the game a try. If you are NOT willing to spend 140 empty hours of your life replaying the exact same maps with the exact same high rank max level killers that has all the unlocks available in the game when you're starting out at level 1 with literally NOTHING available, then steer clear.

I understand that the game may at one time have been fun, but because of endless power creeping (constantly making characters stronger based on the average level and available unlocks of players) this is literally unplayable when you're just starting out. As a survivor, all the killers are designed to be able to handle survivors that has unlocked every single perk in the game, across all the characters available - including DLCs. So when you do NOT have all the unlocks in the game, you're unfortunately still allowed to start matches so you can ruin them for everybody else because unlike them, you haven't already logged over 700 hours in the game and been along for the ride since the closed beta.

As a killer, we're at a reverse dilemma - all the survivors have all the unlocks possible in the game, while you have nothing. So you're pit against 4 players with 700+ hours logged and expected to beat them without a single unlock.

If you play non-stop, you'll typically be able to get your first ""good"" unlock 5 hours into the game. This amounts to roughly 15-20 defeats / hatch escapes (when you are the last man standing because you couldnt help the other survivors, you can escape instantly if you find a secret hatch in every level.).

Repeat this every single match, usually consisting of killers that can run roughly 30% faster than you and typically see you through walls thanks to their unlocked perks, for a week or so, and you'll unlock your first perk. Congratulations! Now you need to repeat this on AT LEAST 3 other characters one by one, and then you have to play a fifth character to a high enough level that you can use all the four perks from the four first characters you leveled up.

Thought you were good to go, huh?

Nah, you also need to depend on RNG giving you the essential skills and items you require to have even a slight chance against a killer, even if that killer is brand new to the game just like you. The survivors typically need something like 100 hours of experience for every 10 hours the killers have if they are to have so much as a sliver of hope that they can survive them without letting all their ally survivors die so they can bail through the hatch.

Don't waste your money. Wait for AT LEAST a 70% sale before you even think about buying this, or better yet an 80%-90% sale. Lukewarm sewage is more fun to play with than this, and honestly it's a shock this is even out of it's early access stage - never mind multiple seasons in with several DLCs.",1578082658,1578102248,False,1,1,0.437909960746765,0,True,False,False,76561198023681900,436,84,308,0,308,1578081891

[h1]What You Need To Know[/h1]
If you want the experience of a Souls-like but none of them drew you in, this is the perfect game for that. Same if you feel Metroidvanias just waste your time, but it's far more Souls-like. Personally I'd even call it open world before Metroidvania, even though it has those classic staples, probably because it's executing them so well it barely feels like the rest of the genre.

[b]Go in as blind as you can[/b], every aspect of this game is about discovery in some way. The point of it is the rewarding feeling exploration and relying only on yourself to beat any challenge gives, and don't worry, it will ease you in and doesn't take a god to finish. I mean, Northernlion finished it.

Keyboard works well, Steam Link will get you killed.
I've encountered no bugs. Ironic.

[h1]The Praise[/h1]
It does so many things competently, and trusts you with complete freedom of approach, that it will keep you interested even if you're not seeking out what it has to offer. No game is perfect, but if you are a fan of the things it focuses on (Souls-like, Metroidvania, in that order) it's what you're looking for perfectly executed. Well, at least everywhere that matters.

Because exploration is so at its core and the game is so easily worth recommending to most people I won't go deep into detail, though I could easily say a lot (mostly flattering analysis) on nearly every aspect of it. Vibrant visual presentation, creatively cute character designs, feels 3d due to deep layered backgrounds, both environmental and direct storytelling is wonderful, unique world, combat streamlined yet deep, renewable universal resource for OCD, fun level design, excellent choices for navigation tools, finding new things is incredibly rewarding and the game is mostly that, the feelings of getting stronger and relying on yourself completely... just trust when most people praise this game, everything it does - it does well - and it does a [b]lot[/b].

I paid as much for this game as I did for Witcher 3, which are the 2 biggest game expenses I've ever made (I'm cheap which may be relevant to you), and I'd pay double for Hollow Knight after knowing what it is and does.

[h1]The (Lack Of) Nitpicking[/h1]
I could nitpick the hell out of it as with anything (wasted soundtrack, low fps animations, sometimes [spoiler]wall grab[/spoiler] just doesn't work, Steam Link movement is imprecise), but problems I found were either very rare or so non-essential only I would care about them.

And most things that may seem detrimental are tradeoffs that fit the atmosphere/feeling the game is trying to create very welll. Like multiple functionalities per key on PC, while wasting most of the keyboard, being another contribution towards simple combat with an extremely high skill ceiling. Or being able to never see whole sections of the game if you miss a secret, which gives your freedom so much more weight and respect from the devs.

I could give this game 10/10 and not feel bad about it, even if it hit none of my interests, and I'm that guy who never gives anything over 9. Not even my favorite games or ones made perfectly to fit my interests.
Any issue I've had with the game is buried so deep under the good that even if it was worth mentioning, it shouldn't be, because it does nothing to make the game less enjoyable or less interesting of an experience.

I actually made a list of everything good and bad from the start, it was about equal for the first biome, then the good just kept growing exponentially and the bad got 1 more note total.

[h1]The Bad, If You Insist[/h1]
(The good is about 14x this long and you should just get the game regardless of your tastes.)
•Intro cinematic has jarringly low fps
•Some moves and character animations inherently have jarringly low fps
•Can't aim up/down and attack at the same time, have to aim before attack (even 1ms can matter)
•Foreground stuff sometimes blocks an important part of the screen, like an enemy
•If you have a hard time deciding which of multiple paths to take first, this game has that
•Music is generic, unnoticable in a bad way, though at least it fits the tone
•There's a move that feels missing in the starting set, but personally, after I got it I quickly grew to appreciate how its absence changes my approach to the game. A lot of things in this game made me consider a similar perspective.
•[spoiler]Wall grab[/spoiler] sometimes fails for no reason
•Steam Link joystick shouldn't be the typical joystick circle they use for all mobile games these days, not only because it's always imprecise since you can't feel it, but because this game has 4-directional movement. It's the perfect game to just put a D-pad overlay for.

I pirated this game when it first came out and never got good at the game because i played it on hurt me plenty on the first few runs and left it abandoned because it was boring.

But then the DLC came out and i finally was able to get my hands on this game, and because of pride or honor, i decided to play this game on nightmare despite being one of the most terrible  players on the planet
[b] And it hurt... [/b]
I died... i died again... and again... and again and again, the pain was real but i forced myself to play throught the master levels and the DLC on nightmare, but every life spent made me learn just a bit more, i slowly started actually using all the tools the developers blessed me with, and before i realized, i can easily beat DLC levels on nightmare, its been months ive played this game, and just like working out, it might hurt at first but if you push yourself for long enough everything else will be a smooth sail and you will enjoy it.
I can tell from experience, starting with the hardest levels as hard as it is made me a better player
This game is marvelous in design, but aside from some distracting visual bugs and overlooked invisible platforms and falling off the map a bunch of times, its a hell off a game, and it will make you enjoy suffering.
10/10 im so sad TLOU2 got 6 awards instead of doom eternal. its safe to say what doesnt kill you in this game, just shows youre improving, bash your head agaisnt the wall a few times until it clicks. i can no longer play in any other difficulty that isnt nightmare or else i wont have fun.

2388436,264710,Subnautica,40542331,english,"Thanks to a couple of my favorite youtubers I found this game while it was still early access and I have been playing it since. I am somehow proud to say this is one of the early access survival games that not only continued development through to full release but also didn't sacrifice the game's quality in an attempt to rush it out to fans. Admittedly there are more bugs than I would like, the most notably obvious being collision issues. Most of the time however, it plays very well. Despite it's beautiful, colorful and almost cartoonish look, this game can be downright terrifying at times, especially if you already don't like the ocean and everything it hides irl. Sonar and soundiin general are your best friends in this game though, as it is not uncommon for a leviathan (huge creature that in most cases thinks you look tasty) to clip into the ground and just ""magically"" appear directly in front of or behind you, luckily they are very noisy.
The story is sparse yet somehow feels suitably complete for the situation. Besides the clipping the only other thing that really annoys me about this game is the building. It is relatively expansive and that I don't have issues with, my issue is that seemingly basic structures aren't included in your ""survival blueprints"", you must find them. Logically it would make sense to have a multipurpose room or a water purifier as part of your basic survival blueprints when the datapad claims to provide blueprints based on environmental hazards, yet you have to find them to make them. Hell, you can't even figure out how to make a door without finding one first. However, this seems to be intended as a way to make the player actually explore rather than hide in their lifepod all day.

Tl:DR version: Good game overall
Pros: beautiful, engaging story, solid gameplay, almost never crashes, normally runs well
Cons: can be surprisingly scary, still has some issues mainly with collision, building can be annoyingly tedious at times.",1520102841,1520102841,True,1,0,0.525862038135529,0,True,False,False,76561198050868900,148,27,9572,0,8191,1600152860

The combat in this game has been talked about a lot, and I have to say that it is some of the best combat in any game I've played and that's not limited to just medieval fighting games. The combat is smooth, and feels so real and this effect is added onto with all the different ways you're able to utilize the weapons you have available.

The dynamic combat, with the way the swords clash and deflect off each other adds to the whole feel of the world as a whole. You feel like you're in a medieval war and it's an incredibly satisfying feeling.

The customization in the game is also stupendous, with fairly balanced progression and lots and lots of helmets, breastplates, and leg armor. This is also expanded on with what feels like a billion options for neck, shoulder, waist, shoes, etc. Customization to get exactly the type of knight you want.

It is literally art, the concepts in the story about life and death, human connection, technology and unity are so interesting I constantly find myself delving deeper into the game world to try and understand it. At first it feels as though you have no idea what is going on but the game does a good job of explaining it, you just have to give it time to develop and the dots will connect. I really enjoy the journeys from place to place, figuring out how to traverse a steep rocky mountainside while carrying all of your gear is unexpectedly satisfying and altercations with BT's will have you on the edge of your seat. The landscapes in the game are amazing and make it such a tranquil experience at times. This really is a game that you can sit down and be at peace in, but there are still thrills along the way. Hideo Kojima's story telling and the rich deep world he has created in Death Stranding has blown me away. The game really does keep you wondering all the time. If you get bored of anything that doesn't have you blowing stuff up or shooting something every second then this might not be for you, but there is combat and weaponry that is very fun to get into and gives you the option of different play styles.

Before I got this game on Steam, I owned it on xbox 360. But with me not being careful with my game discs, it got cracked and wouldn't work anymore.

I was pretty bummed after that happened. So for an early christmas present, I got it on PC! I had to make a Steam account and at the time, I didn't know what Steam was. But after I made an account, I started playing and beat the game pretty quickly (I might be lying, I don't really remember with it being almost 6 years of this happening).

I first heard about this game after seeing to commercial for it on TV.

2150316,381210,Dead by Daylight,23562598,english,"Gotta say.. The game in essence, is fun. However, I find that it is almost impossible to rank up due to the killer rage quitting and making everybody lose the game and all the blood points and previous rank point that they have aquired. It also annoys me that the wraith can just follow anybody he wants anywhere with the survivor having no hope of losing him simply because of his movement speed. It is impossible to hide from somebody that you can't get out of line of sight from. The hooks are placed way to close together. I have had four three people coordinate a rescue from one teammate that got hooked, The wraith managed to kill everybody and then hook every single one of us nearby and win the game. 

Getting into a match in itself if a task. As a survior I have found myself queing up for a match and entering a loading screen which brings me back to the main menu constantly for at least 3 to four minutes at a time before being placed into a match. As the killed you have to pray to god that nobody leaves the lobby otherwise it will never fill up. I have waited 20 minutes as the killer without a single survivor being placed in my game after the initial four. Matchmaking should be based on who has been waiting the longest. Not whatever system that has been set up in this game.

I find that design flaws such as these unacceptable and so I cannot reccoming this game until changes have been made.

I must add, after further experiencing the game I have come across new issues based off of the killer's (host) connection. I have been rubber-banded from escaping the killer and being pulled right back infront of him or being rubber banded back to the opposite side of a window and also teleporting inside of the killer because of their connection. I have now died and lost my rank multiple times because of this. DEVS DON'T MAKE THE KILLER THE HOST OF THE LOBBY. IF YOU DO, AT LEAST TAKE AWAY SOME OF THE CONSEQUENCES FOR THE SURVIVORS.

1789367,381210,Dead by Daylight,75939229,english,"On paper, and for probably the first 50 hours, this game is great. But the competitive nature of this 4v1 horror game is what really makes this not recommendable. You can't opt out of it either, the game has one game mode and one game mode only: online ranked. There's a lot of good things to say about Dead by Daylight, but it all goes out the window once your rank starts getting higher and higher, which, by the way, will happen regardless of how good you are- it's all about how much you play. For context, I hit rank 5 survivor before even realizing what ranks were... and hit rank 1 soon after (and I am NOT good). 

One of the main problems with the game is the meta- a thing you will be forced to face whether you like it or not once you've played a couple of hours. I'm not going to pretend like you don't know the basics of the game, but the simple explanation of it is is that there are 'perks', killers and survivors have only a handful of 'relevant' or 'meta' perks, and everyone has to run those perks or risk simply losing the game (yadda yadda yadda, you've played a competitive game before). Many 'meta' perks are locked behind DLC, but that's (somewhat) irrelevant. The issue is every survivor ends up playing the same, and all the killers pick from the same small pool of perks- making even playing against completely different killers usually play out the same way. Which really ain't fun.

Another problem is that killers are over tuned and survivors are like a bunch of evil rats running around cackling to each other. That is to say that killers have certain aspects to their balance and design that make them 'stronger' than the 4 survivors on a micro and macro level- while on the other hand, survivors tend be annoying little idiots that you either stomp into the ground or watch as they run circles around you. There is rarely an in-between, and neither of the two extremes are fun (nor do they award you with many bloodpoints). 

In this game, whether you are playing as a survivor or a killer (and I dare anyone with more hours to deny this), the majority of your time playing this game is spent saying ""I'm getting camped."", ""This was just a bad game."", ""Oh man, there's an afk."", or ""That was just anti-fun."". Every time you queue up in this game it's either to quench that satisfaction of getting a whole lot of blood points (I haven't even talked about how there are WAY too many progression systems in this) or hoping, and I mean just HOPING that you get something that could be described as a ""Good Game"".

There's some good to this game. Characters from multiple horror franchises crossing over? Cool! Some original characters that have good designs? Great! Nonlinear competitive game? Sounds interesting enough. But at the end of the day, it's just not fun.

Now, that isn't to say this game is doomed. Perks and other things COULD be rebalanced, but it wouldn't quite solve the underlying issues (those of which, aren't worth talking about in a face-value review like this). Many of these issues are at the core of the game's mechanics, and would require some major overhauls to get right, but, yeah, they COULD be fixed. Some other game with the same idea COULD come along and pull off the 'nonlinear competitive horror cross-over party' concept perfectly, sure. But I don't know one, and Dead by Daylight isn't it.

Don't sink your time into this. Don't buy unless it's on sale and EVEN THEN only if you're fine with only putting in at most 50 hours.",1600050623,1600050623,False,4,0,0.525547444820404,3,True,False,False,76561198072690800,59,7,15829,0,15826,1600055595

Now the bad news. This game was unstable form the get go, I have had games where I have built up a sizable settlement, and others where I played for maybe 20 minutes before the game became unstable and I had to scrap that build and start over. While this game has been patched and ""improved"" over time often times the cost has been reduced performance, frame rate drop, and increased stability. The landscape that was once a barren desert with occasion scrubland has become crowded with mostly useless, often view/click blocking props. Additionally most of the props are non interactive so need iron or steel for a weapon, forget the wreckage right next to you and begin your journey for a shiny rock that is actually mine-able.  The addition of mods took some focus off the slow progress on this game and the sometimes bland tone of things. But this is starting to feel like Bethesda like levels of laziness. The graphics are fine for a game that is around 15 to 20 years old and the controls are simple which is usually good but in this case leaves something to be desired. Along with that, numerous key features still have not manifested.
All of this contributed to my mind being blown when the company announced they are beginning work on Kenshi 2 (the prequel). This game is still far from finished, it's barely a beta if we are being honest and the company is looking for another cash grab. They claim they are still going to be updating Kenshi but let's face it with a new cash grab on the horizon the odds of them doing quality work to finish what started off as an amazing game. 
So, an amazing Idea, a promising start, and a plummet into the pit of cash grabs and failed promises. If you see this for $5 or less on sale maybe grab it, just don't go in with high expectations, you will be disappointed. As for Kenshi 2, Hey Lowfi, maybe finish the first game, running to make another when the first is barely a beta (definitely not a stable one) is just a bad look.",1597438190,1597438190,False,0,0,0.457746505737305,0,True,False,False,76561198045174400,276,9,27407,0,25385,1603511563

TLDR it is not a 4X game it is a poor city management game (or ""district management game) where you learn the best or only strategies and watch the game play out. Choice has been restricted through bizarre games design choices.

4X explore, expand, exploit, exterminate. 
Explore: the default map is smaller than civ 5 Huge 128 X 80 _____106 X 66
Expand: A 4X game which penalises expansion by increasing the cost of settlers as you have more cities perhaps at 3500 BC your settlers want more money to leave their condos behind after a single city is founded. Complete nonsense to keep you away from the diminutive map size and terrible faction balance. Note typically expansion is typically what drives forward 4X games by leading to repeated conflict over resources and natural choices over maximising productivity in the short term vs long term. Good news that decision has been eliminated.
Exploit: It is unfortunate your few starting cities did not have iron/horses so you are unable to build many of the starting units but you can exploit by cheesing the ai's stupidity. Trade gypsum for huge amounts of gold at 4000 BC and conquer the AI
Exterminate: War weariness a way to disincentive another core part of 4X games (after making an expansion focus sub optimal) besides making it slow and the AI being dumb. Some factions have large advantages faction starting units 50% better than others one faction available in DLC ignore war weariness (apparently one of the best factions.)

DLC all the best factions come in the DLC and perhaps the game is better with more DLC but it is not a game without it.",1585765194,1585765194,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198000978300,209,4,238,0,238,1585322807

This seems to have worked for the annoying ""jumping"" bs that you have to do, but does little for the terrible camera angles that accompany the jumping missions. It also helped a bit with some of the other mission types like the spooky mask ones where you have to use the mask to make the floor solid, etc. 

Ultimately you still end up with the same poor battle design for the bosses where they just throw a bunch of crap at you and you end up doing it like 100 times before you either put your controller through the screen or just say f'it and continue the nonsense or call it and uninstall it. I really do think that this had so much potential and its a shame that the developers did not do it better.

Started out LOVING this game, got to a few fairly annoying stages with short timers or having the kitchen sink thrown at you and thought ok... maybe not as good as it started out. Then I got to the Toilet Ghost fight and thought ""What a bunch of crap!"" Spent about 2-3 hours trying to fight the SOB without any luck at all then gave up on it. Got to a few other good levels, then got to the Mountain and though ""WOW! This is AMAZING!!!"" Then I got to The Windmill on the mountain, spent about 2 hours falling to my doom got super p***ed and said ""F*** this game!"" then uninstalled the POS! 
I'm sorry to say but if you have to do something exactly right in a game or start the whole f'ing level over again, you need to rethink your design! It's not 1985 anymore and you aren't doing anything to improve the experience by making that swing angle so if the player is just off a bit they fall to their doom. That s**t was stupid back then and even more so now, the only difference is that now you know you are only agitating the audience (not including those who enjoy sadomasochism, clearly this type of stuff may appeal to you).

First thing first, this game OVERRATED! Why? Game is build on a strong STORY which is saving this game and enjoyable. But game play is total mess! It's impossible to play without mods. Everything is unbalanced. Monster, Item levels etc. Simple; You are doing a contract for level 24. Your level is level 19 and you get a level 10 relic sword from level 24 boss. This was a basic sample what you face in this game. While you travel in the world for main Quests and sometime sides, monsters over beating your level many times.

I will not hold this thing for a few years old but good story made game. I'm not recommend this game which is not playable if we consider these broken things. You have to play it with some balance mods from NEXUS... ofcourse better control mod for ROACH the Sh...est ever HORSE! Otherwise you will lose your nerve while you are trying to play this good looking game. Also beware about ""Chromatic Abbreviation"" graphics settings if you don't want to loss your eyes. Turn them off immediately with other few graphics settings in.

Edit: After finishing the game with the Best Ending (Radovid b* dead and Ciri becomes Witcher) I still don't like the gameplay only. And I'm not gonna change my review to positive 'cause of the best story telling. On the other hand, you shouldn't play the game without adding some level/experience balance and horse/combat fix mods.",1577749479,1578952963,False,1,0,0.49396225810051,0,True,False,False,76561198023727600,264,35,20670,0,5472,1580401064

Now here's the ""Spicy"" part of this review. MULTIPLAYERRRRRRR

Sometimes there be some strange lag that pauses the game for about 3 seconds on my end (but really the game is not paused and my character is not moving on other players field of view when i watch kill cam). Only happens sometimes tho. Multiplayer is still alive. Its there....on specific times of the day. I live in North america. I can find 1 or 2 full lobbies around 10am to 5pm or 6pm. After that, there are no lobbies to be found. This IW multiplayer community...I personally think something is mentally wrong with majority of players i'm seeing in lobbies....AND ITS THE SAME PEOPLE. (Remember 1 or 2 lobbies) They play scared to engage in gun fights unless they pull out a shotgun or some overpowered epic weapon that 1 or 2 shot kills you. No real gun skill. Only a about 4 or 5 people with real gun skill plays the game...(and i'm one of them, one is a UK TTV streamer trying to bring IW back with his streams, and one other uses aim assist controller i think). Remember when i said i think something is wrong with players, the recent players that played with you, they session join you randomly when there are no lobbies to be found. I can't count how many times i'm in a custom game with bots finding good settings and mouse sensitivity for myself and some random joins my custom match running around with epic weapons. Its annoying lololoolol. And when they do join, they so quiet and don't want to communicate or they are disrespectful, (AND BELIEVE ME. I TRY TO COMMUNICATE) like...bruhhh. Just stop session joining me. Your not my friend. I don't know you. Mom told me not to hang out with strangers anyway. Some of these players also have a attitude problem. (remember. the same players everyday. 1 or 2 lobbies) This is a good cod. Probably the best jetpack advanced movement game. The movements are so fluid and smooth. Wall running feels amazing. Sound is on point. I can hear exactly where people are and when they jetpack. (dead silence perk is needed for sure) The game mechanics are really good. Weapons are good. (Besides some epic variants weapons that kills you in 1 or 2 bullets. If you use them every game your just toxic lololooollolol) 

Overall...its more fun than the most recent cods (coldwar, MW and BO4)

It is an extremely replayable game that has kept me interested far longer than I thought it would.

There are only a few gripes that I have with this game:
1) As I'm sure you've read in other reviews, the community in this game is by far the most toxic, cringe inducing, sweaty-neckbeards-stuck-in-their-mom's-basement group of degenerates I've ever witnessed in a video game. I highly recommend completely ignoring post game chat at all cost unless you've got thick skin.

2) The game is the first title that Behavior Interactive have developed, and with that status you will notice that this game is riddled with bugs. It has gotten much better with time as the devs have grown, and it is more than playable. However, sometimes glitches and bugs happen that will cause some frustration, but nothing too serious. 

Overall I would highly recommend this game to anyone, even if you don't have friends to queue with, because playing the solo role of killer is where the real challenge and fun lies.

I wish we could play on bigger maps with more players but appreciate it wouldn't run as smoothly the more players you add. I played with 30 different AI and makes you very strategic not wanting 30 civilizations turning on you for your actions.

It would be nice to have a bigger variety of leaders or maybe even having the leader change every so many years than one living thousands of years although this doesn't take from the excitment of the game.

The way districts work and building farms/mines is great. in Civ 2 you could build every single wonder in one city but now you have to think of space for your other districts before deciding where you will build them.

I think the AI acts pretty great until the occasion i get a smaller tribe trying to make demands off me but hey, it happens I guess. Making peace after being at war is very interesting because when negotiating, the cities taken during that war are negotiated with too. sometimes they will happily let you have those cities for peace and others they expect a large price to be paid unless you return them.

If you like mods and like playing in the real world like myself, the ynamp huge earth i think (The biggest that loads full size) is such a big and beautiful map to play on.

I also love what taking over an enemy city involves. Having to get through that cities defences is far more realistic than the past where you killed a unit defending it and just moved in. I have not played Civ5 so don't know if this was a feature in it but great progress regardless.

I also have a misses who has no interest in games like this but I got her playing it too. Got me hooked and I'm sure it would anyone who put enough time into the game to see all the features.

Graphics 10/10: For a game from 2014, for me, It still made to 2017 with excelent graphics, better than those ones in this year from other games.

Audio: 9/10 When you are outside, you hear birds, aligators and animals, you hear them walk and when you are in a cave you hear the water, when you wakl, but I think they need to add more sound to mutants, especialy to the Cowman, or Just ,,Rework'' Them, my opinion

Gameplay: 9/10 The gameplay is good but there are some little bugs where you chop down a tree and the wood from the tree is in air, when a tree fell down on your sadle and it ''Jumps'' up in the air, and there i think it was more realistic if it broke, but still very good gameplay.

Co-op: The co-op is like the gameplay, but there are still a little bugs, like when you are in a very narrow or just narrow space, and your friend try to come where are you, in that narrow space, someone will fly, and I think there's a 50% chance to take damage or not. and if you take damage you need to use a medicine or medicine from plants.

Price 10/10 The price of this game is  only 15 euro, and for a game like this, this price is an excellent one! But in my opinion, i would pay more for this game, not only 15! :)

Fun stuff. WHOLESOME STUFF.

It's nice when you're playing it in (like how me and my friends are) the option where money isn't shared, and the land is split into four parts, so each of you have take care of the land on your own terms. Lot of fighting over who gets to use the carpenter, running over to one of your friend's lands to chop down their trees (PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PRECIOUS FRUIT TREES and the ones like free estate that you can cut for you wood supply) for more wood, spending your time watering someone else's crops cause you got nothing much to do (UNTIL THE SPRINKLERS COME INTO PLAY AND EVERYTHING FROM THEN ON IS STONKS, BABY, AH YEAH), getting competitive over in-game events and games (INVOLVES cursing and laughter), experiencing events together (like dancing with your friends CAUSE FRIENDS GOT THE YOUR LONELY ASS BACK), and, well, watching your farm grow from scratch--- JUST. WHOLESOME. STUFF.

Fans of Half Life, Fans of TF2, and now that our modding ability is growing, fans of any gaming franchise are now arriving.

I'm really happy about that.

My experience of the game was based on the ultra violence difficulty but my words will remain true throughout the review.

I like it how they have really limited ammo and you would actually have to plan strategically with your ammo.  There are a lot of things that have been added to the gameplay like the shoulder flamethrower and new demons that pose more as a challenge. This game also made it feel satisfying with all of the glory kills and with the realistic tear down of a demon as you quickly shoot away its (Quoting doom guy here) ""big guts"" . As of writing this review I haven't completed the single player and rage quit the game in frustration of not being able to clear out a certain section to at least get this review down. The game can have the casualness and action mixed together with lower difficulties and at least paying attention. Speaking of attention, I absolutely love that this game will make sure you aren't gunning down demons just by just shooting that shotgun at anything, they'll always make sure there's some big factor like the spiderdemon exist, it MAKES you pay attention which basically makes the game less boring. Lets switch over to performance terms. I ran this game on a:

I7 8700k
GTX 1060 3GB
16 gigs of ram

I got the card last year (300$ at the time and now it's like 150$ lol) and I got a I7 since Amazon couldn't deliver my I5 and they gave me a I7 instead.

The game ran 45-60 FPS on the default settings (Most of them high with the texture pool being low.) pretty well. I say it's just me and my graphics card and say it's really optimized for cards better than mine. (Lowering the resolution would greatly help too.)


Also wanted to mention the soundtrack in the background, it's too good.

Allow me to start by saying that I adore story-heavy games. Love them to death. 

After reading rave reviews about this game's amazing, tear-inducing plotline, I decided to give it a try. 

It failed to suck me in at first, but I nonetheless stuck with it through the slow, horrendous gameplay, and several exceedingly weird scenes (that one zombie scene comes to mind...), in hopes of eventually getting overwheled by an astounding twist or reveal in the story, one way or another. 

But no such thing happened. 

Instead, I was smacked in the face by the game's excuse of a plotline, tear-inducing in all its right, but not at all through emotional depth or significance, but from its sheer incompetency in being able to make sense, much less entertain. 

Perhaps I'm too critical, seeing to how my opinion is vastly different from many of the others who've played this game and fell in love with it, but the way I see it, ""To The Moon"" is a complete waste of time. 

The game's storyline is convoluted, shallow, and nonsensical at best, and the ""plot twist"" (if it even merits that title), sorry to say, consists of nothing more than sheer STUPIDITY. Paired with it's lazy gameplay mechanics, this game did nothing but frustrate and annoy me the whole way through. 

Although I got it on sale for only a dollar or so, I still feel cheated. I'm never getting those hours of my life back. 
Do yourself a favor, and don't bother with this game. Just don't.

Yet every mechanic that made 2016 so great has been overhauled. Everything seems to be ""more"": more platforming, more enemies, more puzzles. There is a point when this becomes ""too much"", and this is the point Eternal has reached. Who honestly thought DOOM needed underwater sections? A bullet sponge enemy that can teleport between the many alcoves of the map and will summon more demons unless killed? An enemy type that goes against the flow of the gameplay by severely limiting your own play style? Ridiculous Mario Bros style platforming sections complete with rotating fire beams, and puzzles that are often nothing more than a first person pixel hunt? It's as if the thought process behind development went along the lines of ""how can we make everything more annoying? Who plays games for fun anyway?"".

Mind that I did not have much trouble wrapping up the single player; it's not a particularly hard game, just tedious to the point that it becomes a chore.

Mainly play killer enjoy the thrill of the hunt.
The game provides a decent challenge getting harder and harder the more u climb the ranks till as a killer u go against well cordinated survivors that will risk it all providing an amazing challenge aswell as giving u an amazing feeling.

Game example:
> 2 dead
> 1 hooked 
> Exit gates open
> Chasing the last survivor 
> Land a hit they sprint away towards the gate 
> blood pumping 
> Just before they reach the exit u lung foward just hitting 
> spam space inchs from the exit 
> picks up dieing survivor relief makes way to hook 
> gg

Also love to help those survivors where everyone disconnects and the last guy knows hes screwed but u help him out cause u as a killer are screwed on winning anyway.

Firstly, the art style and the music are simply different; they aren't 'better.' I like the former. It's good; it's thorough; it's complete. As for the latter... Well, I'll put it this way: the original's soundtrack is worth buying separately — it's proper enjoyable music. Rebirth's soundtrack as a standalone purchase would be a waste of money. A lot of the tracks are pretty lazy ambiance and nothing else. That is not to say that all of them are below 'good.' For instance, I find the Intro and the Cathedral theme absolutely brilliant.

Secondly, not all new characters seem all that necessary. Azazel, while cool, is completely broken. He's just overpowered and should not have been included. Lazarus seems pretty useless. He doesn't have enough character to warrant his character; as silly as it sounds. Eden is a GLORIOUS addition to the cast though.

This is pretty much it. Those are all the complaints. Everything else is indeed an improvement over the original (dramatic improvements even — in certain areas). The items and combos are fantastic. The reworked boss fights are marvelous. The gameplay at 60 fps is a huge step-up. Bugs are very few and insignificant. I will sink even more hours into this game than into the original.

Beat Saber has, especially modded, infinite replayvalue and a feeling of connection between music, rhythm and gameplayloops that is unmatched by any other musicbased game on the market.
There is, to say the least, a good reason this thing stands as a one-of-a-kind phenomenon in the VR-community.

Being a, while not incredible, fairly decent osu!player, this game, as soon as its conception even started, caught my attention and when i finally got around to play it, i was instantly hooked.
And i am not the onlyone to have made the switch between the two games,
as the custom content for it, the community-rankingsystem and even the difficulty-calculation will feel incredibly familiar to anyone who comes over from osu!, while delivering many more western songs in between, since the community itself is a much more even mix of western and eastern players,

Only thing that i would, while not the games fault per se, since it is nice enough that the developers even keep modding in mind, denote from it, is that maintaining a working environment for custom contents between updates is a bit of a hassle.
But even that gap is becoming more transparent and small, as custom songs start to be perfectly integratable into the basegame without further modding for the most part.

-Weapon hit boxes are actually awful.
-quest items and tips in the game are unacceptably subtle, like ok if we cant see it we don't deserve it but the character in-game feels so hollow and a total puppet. might be better to implement some cutscenes or a ping system in order to connect the character in game and the player.

PROS:
- Immersive enviroment with diverse biomes and creatures
- Great atmospheric music and sound design
- Rewarding sense of progression through unlocking new tools, base components, vehicles and upgrades
- A good balance of fixed biome/POI locations and procedural terrain generation/resource placement adds variety to replays without making everything feel generic

CONS:
- Optimization could be better, lots of graphical pop-ins
- Clunky interface, excessive inventory management (although these can be alleviated somewhat with mods)
- Occasional clipping issues (vehicles falling through the floor, fish swimming through walls into your bases/vehicles)
- No multiplayer

SUBJECTIVE:
- Unlike many sandbox games, has an actual story (told mostly through recordings and data logs) with a defined endpoint
- Emphasizes stealth / running away over combat
- Giant scary roaming leviathans in certain biomes
- Balance-wise, some raw materials / tech options are underutilized given how far into the game they become available, and food/water quickly become irrelevant as long as you remember to bring enough with you on long trips",1542868898,1542868898,True,1,0,0.519230782985687,0,True,False,False,76561197993353300,551,5,35836,0,10761,1604532996

The actual building aspect of this game, outside of the extraction and residential zoning areas for your population, actually seemed fun, if not entirely pointless. I built a mega-church on a hill that produced all sorts of splendor. Then I realized that splendor was for the clergy portion of my population and did absolutely nothing for my population or immediate needs. 

Shortly after, I discovered that I needed to build tents in my marketplace to achieve enough splendor to have a fishing hub. What one has to do with the other, I have no idea.

[h1]Overview[/h1]

A Hat in Time is a 3D platforming collect-a-thon that evokes memories of games like Mario Sunshine, whilst also being able to assert an identity all of its own. The game is spread across just four main levels, but each of these is split into numerous lengthy acts and shorter side challenges. The focus of the game is very much old-school platforming, with little emphasis on combat or overarching plot (though each level has its own contained story to contextualise the platforming challenges).

[h1]Good things[/h1]

[list]
[*]Hat kid controls beautifully. She is really responsive, and landing on small platforms is easier in this game than any other platformer I've played. Because I feel so confient moving around, I am able to play much faster and more fluidly than most other platformers.
[*]Every inch of the game is filled with cute details and shows obvious passion from the devs. Hat Kid is easily the most adorable video game character ever - no contest.
[*]It looks gorgeous! The final main level felt like a 3D Rayman Origins - and I can offer no greater praise when it comes to visuals.
[*]The music is consistently excellent. The main theme is a stand-out leitmotif.
[*]Each level has its own unique gimmicks (even on the act-select screen), which keeps things constantly fresh.
[*]Speaking of which, the game does a great job of avoiding platformer level tropes - like 'The Ice Level','The Desert Level'. The first level is an island fishing town populated by Mafia goons who are bad at cooking!
[*]The writing is Undertale-tier excellent, somethimes invoking the likes of Douglas Adams.
[/list]

[h1]Things that could be improved[/h1]

[list]
[*]You can sometimes see the rough around the edges. The odd texture that's not as detailed as the ones around it. The occasional camera clipping through solid objects and breaking the illusion of solid space. Seriously, these aren't things worth worrying about though.
[*]I feel like most of the levels are just a little bit too big. There's generally stuff to collect everywhere, but you don't need all of it to get 100%. In particular, I think the forest level could do with the areas between the landmarks being removed, to make navigation faster and easier.
[*]Final boss spoilers: [spoiler]While the battle was fun, I feel like the whole heartfelt 'everyone pitches in to help you win' was kinda undeserved. With the exception of Cooking Cat, I don't think any named character hasn't tried to kill Hat Kid. So it feels kinda insincere for everyone to suddenly grow some morals, when they've shown themselves to be completely nasty people (without remorse) just hours before. Maybe give them redemption arcs in their chapters if you want to do this.[/spoiler]
[/list]

[h1]Things that you may like or hate[/h1]

[list]
[*]The voice acting...isn't the best. You might find this really distracting, but it reminded me of the cheap UK children's shows I watched when I was younger, and I [i]loved[/i] that feeling.
[/list]

[h1]Closing thoughts[/h1]

I think that A Hat in Time is a charming, wonderful game that absolutely deserves to be considered alongside the greats like Mario and Spyro (PS1-era spyro, anyway :P). If you have any interest in platformers, you owe it to yourself to give this game a try. No problems I have with the game are significant enough to actually impact my enjoyment of it, and when it is good, it is simply excellent.",1508585663,1513264139,True,2,0,0.504132211208344,0,False,True,False,76561198001497400,152,7,970,0,738,1597433224

With that in mind, this game has great value. 

In terms of the actual game, its a hack and slash game but theres more to it than just spamming ur basic attack. Playing on the harders difficulty requires a bit more strategy and team work, as well as knowing how to manouver around crowds.

Unlike Arma though, I didn't find Sandstorm's realism to be overbearing or annoying to compensate for. Aim down sights is almost always accurate, but the recoil is heavy and hard to effectively control in automatic fire modes. Movement is weighty and running out of breath will remind you to take things slow at times and to gather you surroundings. Bullets have velocity, but don't feel as if their travel speed greatly affects your shot outside of long ranges (you are firing a GUN, afterall). Probably my favorite part of this games player mechanics is the reload system, which enables you to ditch magazines for a faster reload at the cost of losing those remaining rounds, or cancelling a reload which picks up where you left off if the mag has already been dispensed. It's small stuff like this that makes Insurgency so compelling to play, as your individual skill is equated to more that just a point & click adventure.

Weapons, vehicles and environment sound design in amazing. The crack of the M24 and Mosin sniper rifles is distinctive and punchy, while SMGs like the MP7 and Uzi have intimdating chatters that keep the enemy on their toes. Grenades and mortars have a explosions the resonate and rack the battlefield. Yet, I think the most satisfying sound in the game comes from kicking a door off its hinges for an impromptu breach.

This game suffers in one major category: optimization. Luckily, it's a very fixable issue, but one that shouldn't go unaddressed. My ASUS 560 ran well enough, but textures often fail to pop in and framerate will take a dip time and time again. I've heard stories of friends with much more powerful rigs report that their frames become slideshow-like and textures sometimes never appear all match. The devs have noticed and have taken action to make the optimization better, and given how invested New World seems to be to their fanbase, I doubt any similar issues like this will go unaltered.

In the end, I'm hooked. Insurgency: Sandstorm is a hell of good time. It's been the only multiplayer FPS to break the 12 hour mark on my account in years, and is the only game thats managed to pull away from Siege for a while. It's not for everyone, but I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for immersive and rewarding shooter experience.",1546726953,1546726953,True,1,0,0.523809552192688,0,True,False,False,76561198007856300,265,5,2427,0,1164,1593854716

2892968,242760,The Forest,55208601,english,"[h1] WhErE's My SoN!? [/h1]

The Forest is an exploration-based survival game set on a remote island. The story is pretty much a passenger plane you were in crashed, but you survived the crash and some guy took your son. Therefore, your goal is to survive on this island and find the clues and tools to get your son back. Right of the bat this game is beautiful, with even the models having a decent amount of polish. The game also has a decent tutorial that you can view at any time to get you started, and it is not difficult at all to get the hang of. In fact, you might find yourself having a good grasp of everything by an hour in. As advertised, the main highlight of the game are the cannibals. These weirdos have their own unique AI and tribe mechanics and fluidly react to how you play. For example, hide and keep to yourself and you might rarely come into conflict (at the cost of being unable to progress through the story), but cut down all the trees and kill cannibals and you'll find yourself at the end of their full wrath.

Unlike many survival games, at least in my opinion, the game isn't hard. The cannibals are fair to fight, but it can throw some challenges when you'll find yourself facing the beastly mutants. Your goal in the game is to explore various caves on the island to get new gear to eventually unlock the final area and finish the game. It has a surprising amount of story to it as you pick up pictures, tapes, and other items to discover the island's secrets and lore. Almost every cave has its own unique mechanics and sections that makes exploring feel consistently fun instead of like a chore. Outside of that, building options are limited, but tearing down the forest to make your own fortified base and build a GAZEBO can be incredibly satisfying. The AI will react to this, sometimes even being afraid of you and sending more difficult opponents. Combat is typically a ""click to swing"" and back up, and the survival mechanics are iffy. I never found myself distilling water and exclusively ate cannibals and nothing bad ever happened. If you want a decent survival game with horror elements, this is probably for you.

[h1] Pros: [/h1]
[list]
[*]Gorgeous environment
[*]Interesting story that can keep you invested and makes you want to learn more; endings are good
[*]Cannibal AI is fun to interact with
[*]Awesome enemy design
[*]Really fun to play with a friend
[*]Simplistic survival mechanics that don't make you out to be a constantly hungry/thirsty monster
[*]You can build a gazebo on a lake
[/list]
[h1] Cons: [/h1]
[list]
[*]Enemies can feel ""tanky"", especially late game and you have no extra weapons to counter this
[*]Mutants can feel a little overpowered at times
[*]Final boss is uninspired and nothing new
[*]Lack of building options
[*]Lack of variety in animals and enemies
[*]You freeze WAY too easily

I found it to be a pretty easy game; there's a lot to do but I didn't find any of the common enemies to be particularly challenging, and the bosses usually only took a couple of tries, if that. The items you can get are fun but don't make too much of a difference ultimately.

I thought the art style looked really good (in most levels - some of the indoor ones get samey), and I liked the character designs as well. The story was alright - it doesn't seem to require much knowledge of the previous games, which is a bonus.

The concept is simple. Gather resources, research the tech tree, try not to die, and launch a rocket. You soon find it's not nearly that straight-forward and your quest to automate, optimize, and grow will never end. Oh, and there's NEVER enough iron.

Factorio also has the best replayability of any other game I've played. You're always trying new things, new layouts, new strategies. As a result, no two factories you build are ever the same. You can make things as easy or as hard as you'd like too.

I can't be to upset since this game is still in alpha, but hopefully this problem will go away when the actual release is available. Other than that one issue.

However, if you haven't played Portal 1, play that instead. While Portal 2 has more puzzles and better graphics, I don't think it's a better game. The average puzzle in Portal 1 has 4-8 solutions, and the tutorial puzzles show enough that you learn how to use the mechanics, without making you feel like you're being told how to play. Portal 2 takes the subtle parts that made the first game a masterpiece and sort of hamhandles them. The average puzzle in Portal 2 has 1-3 solutions. The introduction of new mechanics, such as the goop, initially makes for more interesting puzzles, but ultimately creates a need to make the puzzles more restrictive and less intuitive. I didn't finish the game. I am an avid puzzle gamer, but one puzzle near the end of the game required such precision, timing, and execution that I couldn't manage it with the level of awareness I had. 

Of course, being a very social gamer, a friend and I flew through the multiplayer maps with no difficulty. I think I will attribute that to the lack of goop.

Ok, play PvE and you'll see players just walk by your buildings and demolish them with no efforts, with no need to fight, just by selecting ""demolish"" from the menu like they belongs to them.

Just imagine: you spend 10 game hours to build something, then a random guy pass and demolish everything then he talks to you - ""I'm the owner of this island, don't build here, go north!"" - There is nothing you can do to oppose to his acting-then-talking so you just do it. - ""Got it, going to build north"".
So you move north and start to build again, then another guy of the same tribe pass by there and destroys everything once again, and then - ""I'm the owner of this island, don't build here, go west!"".

Also, and by no means lastly, the humour is brilliant. Your character has a great sense of dry and sarcastic humour, stating obvious facts, which had me in stitches. There's lots of mini, but sneakily placed, film references or quotes which also add to the humour.

The lack of a useful in-game editor (or even a mod that provides such) is annoying, for one thing, and the advanced options for game creation are less than robust (the 'no barbarians' and 'raging barbarians' tick boxes are especially missed). But my biggest issue of all with this version of Civilization is the AI. It constantly bombards any civilization I play with barbarians, missionaries, etc. and later on with rival civ's declaring suprise wars with a zillion troops at my doors. And there's no way to mitigate or prepare, even on the easiest setting - and diplomacy is a joke because the actual options for discourse are meaningless and very limited.

and instead of adding new maps or content to help the community server admins keep the title going all they added a team deathmatch a firing range,(which still crashes) and a few more cosmetic items. wtf?

I have run ins servers for over 3 years, and 3 of the sandstorm servers that I run are in the top 15 coop servers in the world, I am not sure I will continue,

I feel the push to console and lack of developers is steering them away from their core old market, they say they have sold 500, 000 copies but there are only about 1.5k  so thats allot of  unhappy players. perhaps tdm has more potential but I think its just silly.

dont get me wrong it can still be fun and it has huge potential, 

in time its one to watch if it survives, once new content and bug fixes are complete I would wait until this id done. perhaps a few moths or years, the console looks promising though. :)",1551464347,1551466354,False,11,0,0.552521526813507,0,True,False,False,76561198011727300,21,2,45385,715,10005,1611348166

After depending more on hunters gatherers and fishermen, plus reducing the farms and orchards to 7x7 plots with one farmer each, the starvation seems to have ended.

Survivor gets hooked and trapper places bear trap underneath them, then goes off to wait in the distance, so survivor(even high level players) suicide because freedom from the hook ain't happening.

Survivors vs Wraith:
Survivor gets put on hook, wraith goes to wait in stealth in the distance. As long as your other survivors are not hurt, you have a chance to get away as long as your willing survivors want to take a blow to their shoulder or they'll leave you for dead.

Survivors Vs Hillbilly:

[h1]First off short answer: Yes, I definitely recommend it![/h1]

The thing that should be addressed first is probably the developers: You're doing amazing work! Six years after the game came out there are still regular update and DLC and for example with the Germany rework you can definitely see that they have improved. Things like the trailer ownership also added ""replayablity""

The game might seem like it get's boring after a while, but with the above mentioned regular updates, mod support (defiantly give TMP a shot) and amazing community (like VTC's for example) there's always something new to try

Also you can choose how hard and/or immersive the game is. For example, you could go all out and spend additional money on a wheel, eye tracker, shifter, etc. , but you can also just play with mouse and keyboard. (Ran it with everything from keyboard over a X-BOX 360 controller to a G29. Had no problems with anything) You can have your mirrors and navigation as HUD elements, but you can also look around yourself and follow the road signs

In conclusion: I really don't have anything negative to say about this. Definitely give it a try!",1545684406,1567690202,True,35,3,0.757834315299988,0,False,False,False,76561198132679600,91,2,44449,0,25567,1608434573

3713744,367520,Hollow Knight,46129157,english,"A wonderfully crafted metroidvania. Well done 2d animation and an amazing soundtrack that fits perfectly for its immersive world and subtle storytelling. Challenging, but very fair. The combat is simple to understand and the bosses are well designed with no artificial difficulty. Some may find it starts out slow, but the game encourages and rewards exploration with optional upgrades, items, and bosses. The nonlinearity only adds to this. There is no strict set path of progression (go from area A to B, pick up power up then head to C and D, etc), so progression comes naturally as you explore new areas and branch off from there. This game has one of the best interconnected worlds I have seen.

You get an amazing value at 15 dollars. The base game is great as is, and you get 4 additional free content packs which add more bosses, items, and a small bit of additional lore/story. The last content pack ""Godmaster"" is dedicated to a boss rush that fits nicely into the world of Hollow Knight and it's narrative so it doesn't feel out of placed or tacked onto some side area. 

My only real gripe with this game is that one small section of the endgame content from one of the additional content packs is a brutal step up in difficulty. It is not impossible, but it is an outlier with how Hollow Knight handles difficulty. This is, however, not necessary for completing the base game and it is essentially ""post game"" content. The other 95% of the game is fair in it's difficulty and will provide you with a very generous amount of game time for the price you pay. My first playthrough of the base game took me roughly 40 hours. Your mileage may vary, but the amount of quality game for this price tag makes it a strong recommendation for any fan of action-adventure/metroidvanias.",1542854393,1542854393,True,2,0,0.547325074672699,0,False,False,False,76561198095813500,106,3,8105,0,7859,1561951821

Isaac kept to himself drawing pictures and playing with his toys as his mom watched Christian broadcasts on the television. Life was simple and they were both happy. That was until the day Isaac's mom heard a voice from above:

""Your son has become corrupted by sin. He needs to be saved.""
""I will do my best to save him, my Lord,"" Isaac's mother replied, rushing into Isaac's room, removing all that was evil from his life.

Again the voice called to her:
""Isaac's soul is still corrupt. He needs to be cut off from all that is evil in this world and confess his sins.""
""I will follow your instructions, Lord. I have faith in thee,"" Isaac's mother replied as she locked Isaac in his room away from the evils of the world.

One last time Isaac's mom heard the voice of God calling to her:
""You've done as I've asked, but I still question your devotion to me. To prove your faith, I will ask one more thing of you.""
""Yes, Lord. Anything,"" Isaac's mother begged.
""To prove your love and devotion, I require a sacrifice. Your son, Isaac, will be this sacrifice. Go into his room and end his life as an offering to me, to prove you love me above all else.""
""Yes, Lord,"" she replied, grabbing a butchers knife from the kitchen.

Isaac, watching through a crack in his door, trembled in fear. Scrambling around his room to find a hiding place, he noticed a trapdoor to the basement hidden under his rug.

I am 25.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline broken. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Is it worth buying? will it be a fun game to play? Can I use my XBox controler for PC or play on Xbox. Yes to all the above, that is if you like this type of game and gaming exp.

Keep in mind though this game is still in the development stage and things may change in the future. With that said for me at least as of right now it lacks a truely engadging story line. for some this may not be importent to you. But for me it would be a deal braker. The game does however have the starts of a genaric storyline and may become deeper as the game progresses (When and if that is added). Subnotica is not a multi player game. For me at least I am truely greatful for that there are to many games of this type that are. And for this game to be multi player would pretty much kill it for me. I would though like to see co-op maybe, but pvp I have never been a fan of. Other wise subnotica could just be tossed in the cookie cutter bucket game catagory with all the others.

5412986,782330,DOOM Eternal,69192842,english,"Changing my review due to the removal of denuvo anti cheat. Doom Eternal improves upon every aspect of 2016: performance is better then ever, running at a solid 60 fps despite looking even better then its predecessor, load times are very short, where 2016 would often take at least 60 seconds to load each level, eternal usually has them loaded within 5 seconds of loading a mission, if it even needs to load at all, only had one crash during my 30 hours of playtime, and that was after 5 hours of non stop playing (cant speak for the unholy denuvo times). Gunplay is improved, weapons feel better then in 2016 and have (mostly) better mods, the meathook is so useful I cant even play any previous doom game without feeling like something is missing, some less used mods from the previous game have been changed, for the better too. Having less ammunition has been criticized by some for limiting them from using their favorite weapon, but I think it is a welcome change, letting you think about what weapons work better against different enemies, adding a strategic element to every fight. The soundtrack is still amazing, Mick Gordon never fails to deliver (his presence will be missed in future doom installments). The story is a welcome addition, cutscenes are easy to skip if you dont care, but if you want more of a reason to rip and tear doom eternal gives you some, it also explores the slayers origins, which if you are a hardcore doom fan is welcome content. Overall Doom Eternal is a welcome addition to the doom franchise and if you have even a passing interest in fps games you are doing yourself a disservice but not picking this game up right now, with or without sale.",1589570652,1590650104,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198271652300,83,6,2919,0,1728,1602980426

2697667,240720,Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy,68203250,english,"I'm gonna be blunt: if you get angry easily, this game suits you about as much as an anime cosplayer in the midst of a basketball convention. You put your effort and time into this game, and after a few hours, have made some progress. Suddenly, you reach an obstacle you've never seen before. Your hands start to sweat (more than they have been from holding the mouse for so long), you feel your heart beat a little harder, and your previous gameplay flashes before your eyes. You finally decide to take the risk, as there's no sense in waiting. You jump, your cauldron sailing through the 2 feet you have to work with, hoping beyond hope that the Foddy Gods will pour their blessing out on you, holding your breath at the time...

But to no avail. With just a little slip of your hammer, you're caught in a downward plummet with no hope of restoration, praying that you won't have landed too near the beginning of the game, where your journey began a mere few hours ago...
Has it really only been that long...?

Just look up on Youtube ""Getting Over It Rage Compilation"" and you'll find a seemingly endless stream of videos of various people reacting to content in the game, whether it be glitches, loss of progress, or finally...FINALLY...beating the game after so much heartbreak and feelings of hopelessness. 

If you're the kind of person who loses your temper rather easily, this is the game that is on the complete opposite end of the spectrum of games you should play. 

That's looking at it at face value, though. But what if you look deeper?

Getting over it is a game, as Mr. Bennett himself states, where ""No amount of forward progress is guaranteed"" (okay, maybe that line was meant for a different game, but it's implied that it's also meant for the game at hand). No matter how hard you try, even if you have 20 hours of experience inside your cauldron, you're still, at all times, at risk of ""falling and losing everything"". That example near the beginning of this already too long review is not something you'll experience only once when playing this game, I promise you that.

But maybe in that reason, Getting Over It is the perfect game if you have difficulty keeping your anger in check. As you toodle along with only your hammer to propel you, Bennett makes philosophical remarks during your trip, and offers encouragement and motivational sayings if you happen to plummet. And it's in those ways the game can offer more insight than you expected in ways you least expect it. In other words, this game could *possibly* be used as an anger management tool and special insight into life, opening up new ways of thinking and looking at things that you'll carry with you for the rest of your life...

But probably not. In all honesty, it's just a silly game where you drag yourself up a mountain with only a hammer and cauldron to keep you company (and Bennett, of course).

Do with the game as you will (unless you want to spend your $8.55 on fast food. Honestly, who wouldn't?).

and the controls are SO FIRM, the only thing holding me back is my sluggish fingers, no, seriously, I am slow, but that didn't stop me from completing the tough-as-nails C-Sides WITHOUT assist...

Celeste portrays mental illnesses exceptionally well, not your like your run of the mill book, but in a completely realistic and relatable way (just search this up, I will never string up enough words to describe it.)

Despite the sheer difficulty, Celeste has remained an enjoyable game through my playtime, one that actually gives me a sense of pride and accomplishment for completing a brutal level... not like that one company we all hate...

Oh, lastly, the music, most important.
Celeste's music is atmospheric, energetic, and at times dark, it gets power powerful during B-Sides, filling you with the determination needed to press on, despite your never ending deaths.
Yes... the music sure does set a powerful atmosphere...

The pixel art is pretty, the OST is great, and the mechanics are pretty solid.

It's just the gameplay that falls flat on it's face.

The one-shot-kill-or-death thing is pretty overrated.  Half of the bosses feel exactly the same, with only a tiny change in mechanics.  It's waiting for that half-second opening and daring death, as you almost always have to nearly trade your life to score the killing blow.

Some bosses get downright asinine, having ""magnetic"" attacks (attacks that follow you when you get too close), or even creating deadzones (give me a break; it's sitting there, but if I touch it, INSTANT DEATH!  No, not pushed into it, poke it, INSTANT DEATH!).  It all gets rinse-lather-repeat, and you start to see the same thing in every boss, with a handful of new 'features' over the previous boss of its' type.

By no means does that make this a poor game; I just believe the developers could have done better.  It felt like, ""Well, it's WAY too short unless we add a few more titans...""

With no expansion of the player, no new methods of gameplay and approach could be added to the bosses, thus it all becomes stale by the time you reach the end.

The story, itself, while intriguing, is another one of those disingenuously vague ones that reveals and tells almost nothing.  What little bits and pieces are there reveal next-to-nothing of what's going on, or even why you're there.  It's another one of those, ""the description of the game tells more about the story than the game itself.""  After a certain point, you start to ask yourself, ""Why the heck am I even doing this?  What's the point?  Big flashy lights!  Woo!  Okay.  Getting bored, now.""

I think this game is a great feat in the world of multiplayer cooperation. It has the most balanced skill low to skill cap ratio of player to player I've seen with low tier killers going great against low tier survivors vise versa to high tiers. Sadly no dedicated servers but still holds up nicely. 

Pro's: Developers still working on big updates and bugfixes.
Active community.
Entertaining and great replayability with skill cap always being able to be raised.
A game reliant on player (survivor and killer) error encourages those to become as good as possibile keeping the community vast in it's skill level and abundent in players.
The game can geniuenly cause great fear to the survivors and satisfaction to the killer which creates a thrill in each game.
The soundtrack is great and each song fits perfectly to the situation(to the point where the song playing fits so well you don't even notice it at times{also a con check last con}.

Con's:Many players complaining about balance issues likely due to map design and a perk or two.
Game needs polish when it comes to some of it's core mechanics.(flashlights useless if killer knows to drop survivor instantly after brought to bleeding state)(Killers getting stuck in pallets)The list could go a bit further beyond than just this...sadly.
The soundtrack as said above is great but at times I feel it is playing too quietly for me to appreciate it and for it to do its job of installing fear into me as a survivor and make me feel truly unstoppable as a killer.(Hopefully a feature to increase and decrease the volume within a certain margin without muting it will be added) When listening to the soundtrack on youtube there are so many details shallowed out by other sounds that the real power the soundtrack delivers is missed.

Overview: This game is a 100% worth buying and I don't regret a single hour I have put in. Even with my current 281 hours as of this review I have much to master and learn still.

-Massive interesting world
-Deep veiled lore
-Endless gameplay options
-Mods make the game somewhat better
-Sense of accomplishment at the little achievements

Cons:
-Bugs bugs bugs
-AI pathfinding is mired in dog shit
-Mods make the game somewhat better
-Only game I instantly modded shortly after playing
-Enemy mobs spawn on you in the middle of nowhere
-Team micro is a nightmare even with in game functionalities implemented for micro
-Characters constantly ignore orders or go eat food at their own whim and path into slavers like idiots

I really REALLY want to like this game and my play through has become a sunk cost fallacy at this point even though I want to see it through. Bodies will ragdoll into the stratosphere literally when you place them on the ground. This can result in team deaths, losing prisoners, or even bounties. Speaking of losing bounties-- for no fucking reason at all the game despawned a wounded Gutterhead from my character's arms. So then I had to load a save an hour back or lose the 10K bounty my scout squad had been working towards for over a week since they're either burnt to a crisp by the Eye the instant they leave Gutterhead's tower, or Beakers spawn in front of the building when I try to leave. It's bad enough that I lost all the other Scav prisoners now because of having to abandon them, them launching into space when I put them down, or them dying to ""random"" Eye blasts hitting my squad.

A little slow, combat is a bit of a bore and the story elements are stretched to far apart.  Lots of check points though so you don't feel railroaded to complete something that has lost its fun by just throwing waves of fodder that you don't want to go through again.
Not a don't buy, just a make sure you know what you are getting into.

Change Note: Seems like there is a lot of fun lore and mystical areas that would make for an interesting world if not for snakes with no-reload shot guns.  Really just sad that at every turn they put another road block you have to smash your head against until you've memorized the pattern.  The game is not worth the work.

The multiplayer feels absolutely nothing like any of the COD games in the past which I like. I wasn't looking for a copy of BO3 with a new storyline and new guns. I personally have not had any connection issues myself, but a few of my friends have. There are a few maps which are a little small and cramped but once you figured out how to manuever in the game (stop thinking black ops 3) the maps can really be used to your advantage. My one issue is....graphics, I have a 980Ti and the game runs fine, generally around 100-110FPS, but my goodness it looks like crap. I feel like salt and pepper is covering the screen along with some weird blur stuff thrown in as well. Right now I'd rate the gameplay 4/5, graphics 2/5, stability 4/5. So overall, I'd give it somewhere around a 3.5-4 out of 5. Its a good game, and im sure it'll get smoother and better as more patches come out. Many games have had way worse starts than this, so don't be too quick to judge it.

Post Release Review:

This game is beautiful, fun, and occasionally challenging.  The Graphics and design are exceptional.  The gameplay is tight and extremely fun.  The environments are well designed and some offer decent exploration and have no clearly marked paths which is a lovely change of pace. Overall it is a blast and one I highly recommend.

Unfortunately I have seen the steam reviews for this game go down roughly 6 percent in a day.  This largely seems to be due to lots of people finding the game too difficult.

Lets talk about difficulty real fast.  This is designed to be a difficult game.  Even on recruit you can not idly wander about and just spam a single button and win, for the most part. I do not struggle with the difficulty and soloing recruit and now veteran while I wait for my friends is not a problem. That being said I highly recommend playing with friends or finding some like minded individuals in the community to group with regularly.  

The combat is deep.  It is meant to be.  You need to learn how each weapon plays.  Blocking, dodging and pushing are integral in the combat system.  Correct use of melee weapons and ranged weapons depending on situation is a must.  Using things like choke points and crowd control during a horde rush are necessary.

Obviously some things just go wrong sometimes.  For instance I encountered a troll on a narrow cliff, which would have been fine keeping your back away from the edge so you do not get thrown off and so forth, when a chaos patrol came from one direction and a storm vermin patrol came from the other.  It was brutal and we nearly pulled it off but we ended up wiping.  It happens, it was still execptionally fun. 

It is unfortunate that people feel the need to give a negative review on the basis of difficulty in a game that promotes it.  I do not see dark souls games filled with negative reviews claiming it was too hard.

Regardless I wish my fellow Brothers of the Reichland glory and honor on the battlefield. I will see the others who love this game out there amongst the horde.

- Speaking of energy it runs out so fast and can be really frustrating to constantly skip days in order to have energy again.

- When I cut down a tree near a pond that was auto spawned, the items that have cut down, if the tree is to fall in the direction of the pond, should land on the ground nearby. I'd like to not lose all of my items in the water.

I've been playing this franchise since the start and each new iteration makes it better and better. With all the dlc over the years the game has seen nothing but improvement and growth. I'm really enjoying the introduction of weather and storms. I find the new modes of play to be interesting, especially the Secret Societies game mode. I do, however, recommend picking the game and it's dlc up on a sale. The base game is fun but the dlcs makes it shine. Thus pick it up on sale so you can get the best play experience. This is also a fun game to play with a friend as the AI makes a horrible partner, but what game has a good AI partner? Not many. 

I've really taken to the Religion part of the game. I think that's my favorite part, creating your own faith and then spreading it across the world. It's fun to create your own faith and pick the tenants and to create warriors of the faith who will go out and do battle in the name of The One True Faith. World Congress is also nice. The ability to trade influence makes interacting with the AI a bit more fun and dynamic.

I also recommend listening to the dev's commentary, it's really cool.

Wheatley's character was really fun, Stephen Merchant was definitely the best choice for his voice! Also GLaDOS's character development was interesting, as you don't really get much of her personality in the first game (because of the cores).


Now something more personal: 
I loved it so much I ended up making an awful lot of fanart of it... then put some of them on shirts for myself.
I also joined a support group to accept the fact that there's nothing else to do in life after you finish it and there'll always be a hole in your soul no other game can fill.

1) Soundtrack is so beautiful. I can hardly believe my ears when the angelic melodies are played.
2) The art style and graphics work very well for the atmosphere. I love the clouds for undiscovered territory.
3) Gameplay can vary between light and awesome moments of exploration to intense combat with countries across the world to desperately trying to scrounge up money to fund your armies. Love it.
4) The controls are amazing. They're almost intuitive. The guides help a bunch if the controls do get confusing.
Verdict: 10/10 game. Will bankrupt country again.

Story for review:
 When my uncle sold me his PC, he bought me this game and told me that it will consume my soul or something like that. XD. The only strategy games I'd played by then were Halo Wars and RUSE. I figured this one might be too complex to play so I didn't for a couple years. I was missing out. 0_0.
He made me try it out and now I've a hard time stopping! It has such tense moments where you can have your own Cold Wars with other countries. I'm in one with Denmark. They have the largest military in the world. They've taken over all of Europe, Africa, the Middle East, Asia, half of Austrailia, and some of the Philippine Islands. They had control of Hawaii but I wrested it from them and turned it into a base that I used to destroy their navy. They attempted to strike behind my battle lines by colonizing some of Canada but I took those cities, too. Despite their overwhelming numbers, they eventually called for a peace treaty. I signed the treaty so fast my pen burned. Be wary, newcomers. Some of the ""peace treaties"" will suggest you to surrender entire sections of your countries to them. I caught Harold Bluetooth doing just that. He didn't get my cities but we still made a temporary truce. Now we're uneasy again. I've rallied an invasion force and am prepared to press the DECLARE WAR button.
Nothing but the AI and the stats are written by the developers. The game teaches you how to do basic things and after that, your actions are your own! Examples: you can create a peaceful and loving nation that seeks unity and scientific advancements or you can become a tyrant that nukes everybody and takes over the entire planet. It's such an amazing game that's been different every time I play it. Sometimes I'm technologically inferior to larger civs, sometimes my forces are mechanical gods against their peashooters. If you want an addicting game with tons of value, get this. You won't regret it.",1497180718,1497181044,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,76561198151415700,56,8,6839,0,2852,1573294043

1662963,8930,Sid Meier's Civilization V,22925024,english,"Well i think now is the right time to review this game since civ vi has been announced i was thinking about waiting some more til i beated the ai 2 times, but 194 hr is probably more then enough for most of us to make and accurate review.
I will simply say in those 194 hrs i played i have just beat and won vs the ai once.
So what is there to say well you got alot of options in how you play the game , you have 4 ( 5) types of victories: Cutlure, domination , science, diplomatic and time ( witch is based on a lot of factors)
This a game i suggest buying if you can play for a couple of hrs, this isnt a game you just play 30min-1hr and you take a break. ( played with a friend was supposed to go to bed and 1 and half hr later we was done talking and could get to bed) Yeah the game is a blast to play with friends.
This is one of the few games who have learned me something about history and ""great"" peoples
Great turn-based gameplay
A lot of good strategy , planning, different ways to play it , with alot of great and different civs to use.
If you like strategy games , and dont mind turn based this is most buy on PC. 
I dont wanna sound like a guy that give 10/10 to each game not that i do that buy for a strategy game this is the closest thing i can get to a 10/10.

The only bad thing i can say about this game is that it starts slow and not until you reach at least turn 50-100 it starts to get really good, however  those 50-100 early turns goes pretty fast.
PS: i didnt like the orginal civ 5 much until both expansion pack came out , then i really liked it.",1463053169,1463122866,True,3,0,0.520099222660065,0,False,False,False,76561198029094000,241,73,12862,0,11183,1464016083

However, I really wish the guy who made it would take out the weirdly ridiculous sexist programming, or at least make it so the men are more useful. I'm on day 40+ in my colony and the men keep hitting on all the women every single goddamn day and getting rejected.

I seriously have to give my male colonists more time off of work and other special treatment to compensate for this ""feature"".

If you won't fix the men at least make it so I can generate female colonists only.

First what I don't like: the menu and the HUD elements. They don't have that serious feel that Doom (2016) had.

4940579,552500,Warhammer: Vermintide 2,46511319,english,"Graphics: Visually, a very solid title. The visuals themselves are great, and the environments are quite convincing. Lighting is good, and the overall atmosphere is very fitting of the Warhammer universe: grimy, run-down, and gloomy. Physics are great as well, and in a game with so many bodies falling and flying through the air from the occasional explosion, this is a notable plus. Performance-wise, this game seems to run quite well on Nvidia hardware, but can struggle with equivalent AMD hardware. It's still bearable, but it's not equivalent.

Audio: The soundtrack for this game isn't really noteworthy if you ask me, but it's no bad either. The weapon sounds are great, and many of them feel chunky when hitting an enemy, as they should. This really adds to the satisfaction of the gameplay. Perhaps most importantly in this category, however, are the voice lines and voice acting for all of the playable characters in Vermintide 2. Both the random and scripted lines are well done by the actors and actresses, and they add a surprising amount to the game, as the player gets a lot of backstory and information on the relationships between the characters through their dialogue. Some of it can be rather entertaining as well.

Gameplay: First, take note that I'm a more casual Vermintide player, meaning I don't often touch the higher difficulties, so that may make my review misaligned with many others. It's very fun to play with friends, and can be a bit of a challenge as well. It's satisfying to me both on the direct gameplay level, as well as the over all progression level. It's not exactly my go-to game, but I still play it from time to time many months after release.
As far as balance and difficulty, I think when played on ""Veteran"" the game is challenging enough to require one or two players at least who are knowledgeable, but it isn't frustratingly difficult, and this difficulty allows the player to access all content in the game and receive the most powerful drops, albeit with a lower drop rate.
Regarding bugs and other negatives, I haven't experienced many as of late, and connection issues are far less of a common occurance than they used to be. In fact, I can't remember the last time I encountered a game-breaking bug. There are physics glitches with corpses rubber-banding or clipping through part of the environment from time to time, but that isn't a surprise with the physics engine.
I know the last two point I've made are the source of most of the controversy surrounding this game, and while they are valid, they haven't at all ruined the experience for me or my friends. I would say this game is worth your money and your time if it looks interesting to you, especially if it is on sale.

TL;DR: Fun Left 4 Dead-esque game, and even better with friends. Gameplay is enjoyable and satisfying, as is the overarching progression. There's also potential for very high-level, high-difficulty play, though I haven't personally experienced it, as I'm not all that interested. Overall a solid buy, especially on sale.",1542948109,1542948109,True,0,0,0,0,False,True,False,76561198060960900,918,10,7298,0,3732,1607049556

This review comes as an attempt to offer a clear perspective on the game, in contrast to some of the negative remarks on Steam and on the internet.

Having played extensively all the previous games of the series, i consider DoW3 to be a very good game. The graphics and atmosphere are great, the gameplay and combat mechanics are fun and refreshing, the army customization is the deepest of all the games and it has much much room for future growth.

Let's take it from the top:

1. Campaign
The campaign is fun, much more to the style of DoW2. There is a storyline and every mission moves the storyline forward. You will play equally all factions during the campaign mission, which will allow you to level up some important Elites and gather a lot of skulls to unlock them.
The missions are varied and fun, some of them are typical build you base and eliminate the opponent, other are take your Elites only and bash some heads and they are generally pretty fun! During the campaign you will get to know and utilize all aspects of DoW3 combat and resource mechanics.

2. Multiplayer
If the campaign was the bones of the game, then the multiplayer is definitely the meat of it. You jump into 1v1, 2v2, 3v3 combat with your friends or with AI. 
Now, you will hear a lot of crybabies saying that DoW3 has turned into a MOBA. 
<Insert Darth Vader image with quote ""I am your Father"">
MOBAs evolved from strategy games but they don't have base building and you can't control the minions. In DoW3 you have base building and you can also fully control your army, along with your powerful Elites. So, yeah.
In strategy games you always had to kill the enemy headquarters to win by elimination, in DoW3 the headquarters have been renamed to Power Cores. So, yeah.
The only thing that has been added are the Turrets and the Shield Generators, which have been added for the sole purpose of avoiding early game rush tactics which end the game in 5 minutes. And it works as intended. 
So, yeah, back to Starcraft with you guys. 

3. Customization
You can choose a roster of 3 Elites with their respective Doctrines, as well as 3 Army Doctrines. Selecting which ones you want to use will vary against your opponent and will alter your gameplay dramatically. There is something for everyone here, and it's very satisfying finding a build that works well together in theory and then verifying that by bashing some heads on the battlefield.

Final Verdict:
9/10
It's a clear 9. The only thing holding this game back is the lack of Chaos, Necrons and Tyranids. But i have a feeling that work is already under way for further expansions, like in Dow1 and 2. Thank you Relic, good job on this one!",1493559013,1493559339,True,6,0,0.5113485455513,0,False,False,False,76561198013426200,69,1,1855,0,1569,1600506714

Well, well, well, and here I am reviewing this amazing game. I started playing when it was just an Early Acces (December 2016), and I experienced a lot of new updates and graphics overhauls until Subnautica got released.

I highly recommend this game because it inmerses you in a new type of open world enviroment, one in three dimensions. Going deeper under water, discovering abandoned bases while escaping from deadly creatures, and trying to unravel the mysteries of the precursor intelligent life forms that live in planet 4546B will take you to a lot of gameplay hours that you will enjoy.

If you want to find out more, please you are more than welcolme to take a look to this Youtube playlist:

Sometimes a developer has to ask which is the more important aspect of the game, the story or the gameplay? But then there are games like this that say BUGGA to the gameplay and invite you to a world that is both amazing feels and right at home. This is a (VERY) story driven game about a man who is about to die and is given one wish to change his memories of his life before he passes away. I have to say that I enjoyed the game and wish this type of storytelling will appear in the near future with more tales or new ideas. The only problem I had in it was that sometimes the comedic relief would ruin the critical moments.

In total I give it 8/10 An interesting story that shows that gameplay doesn't always have to be main focus of a game and simple life delimias can be entertaining instead of saving the world from complete and utter disaster.",1395059355,1395059355,True,2,2,0.508202195167542,0,True,False,False,76561198091682600,488,50,301,0,301,1386392874

It's tons of fun with friends or patent pros, but not too punishing with the P(ick)U(p)G(roup)s you might meet via quickplay. The character banter is nearly as good as in ""Dragon Age: Inquisition,"" and the canonically detailed grim-dark fantasy setting will satisfy fans of Warhammer, horror, and eye-candy. The hack & slash melee feels meaty and satisfying.

    If you are a hardcore headshot fetishist like myself, your pituitary gland will hammer your joy-button with a pint of endorphins for every solid *PLINK* you get for demonstrating your skill. You'll also appreciate the reasonably diverse enemy-types, like how the ratties have a hunch that can block headshots from behind unlike their plague-addled human counterparts.

dead quiet..
i scan every direction
i see a black silouette against the white moonlit sand, it dashes left into the tree line 
i hear chittering and giggling, as if i was too easy of prey
i hear rapid foot steps like a bear bounding toward me 
i turn around to see a lean grey skinned beast of a thing staring into my soul as if my eyes would be the first snack, an appetiser
out of fear and panic i close the distance with my axe and land a clean blow to the thing's face
i looked for a moment to see a shell of a person, as if lucifer had a batch of children
i turn away from it and retreat to my small fainting fire
i feed it, only to hear blood freezing maniacal laughter behind me
id been fooled..
the very same creature rose again with its peers circling me
taking no chances this time i struck it. then i hit it again, and again
the others retreated.. this was only the first night

If you love any of the following you will enjoy this game:

- Exploring
- Gathering
- Crafting
- Building
- Unique Story Lines
- Mystery
- Survival
- Beautiful Atmosphere
- Alien Anything

I have been playing on PC. The lag that most people complain about is only really noticeable if you are moving very fast or entering/exiting menus in quick succession. The bugs that I have encountered so far are minimal. There are some things that don't have icons when placed in your bag, and the physics on the moving islands in relation to your character are a bit off, but both of those are to be expected with an Early Access title. Neither of them are game breaking or retract from how lovely the game is. I chose to follow the story line and explore as I go to each of the points of intrest, and I am extremley intrigued and excited to find out what happens next. My friend chose to free roam and he constantly squeals in delight at each new thing he encounters. Different ways to play, but we are both enjoying ourselves immensely.

After you have procured all your needed resources you start to think a bit bigger. Food is commonly a saught after resource and planning for the next seasons is neccessary but eventually you will grow the ability to explore.

Some people may aim to escape the dreadful planet on a rocket ship, either by building one or traveling to a remote location far away. While others may enjoy anywhere from primitive to advanced ways of peaceful living. 
If you wanted to you could become a colonizer and literally dominate an entire world with your populace.
Or instead you could choose to be a raiding group and do nothing but murder everything in your bloody path. Carful though, those giraff looking things WILL RIP YOUR ARMS OFF! thats ok though, just get a surgeon to sew them back on, or someone elses limbs...Or a a shiny new metal one! But wait, what if you dont want to do any of those things. 
I just want to be a hermit in the woods with a bear as a pet. Well its ok, because you can do that too.

I love this game, and you can too. The price is up there a little but realisticly compaired to tripple A games, the gameplay here is worth three of them and their selling at $80 - $90 a pop!

I know it says 300+ hours on record, most of those hours are my sister-in-law, whom I bought the game for. One day she was talking about how she wanted to get the game. I had heard of the game but had never really looked at it. So I jumped on steam to give it a look, and low and behold it was on sale for ten bucks, I figured why not.

Now for the review.
This is one of the few games that I actually get more enjoyment from watching other people play, as opposed to playing myself. Is the game buggy? Yes, But by looking at my game collection you will see I own a few Bethesda games, so obviously that is not a deal breaker for me. While this game is not my preferred type of game it is enjoyable, I prefer more story driven games. Some of the players can be douchebags, but that is with any online game. Just shrug it off and move to the next match. I play survivor mostly. I am a horrible killer and only play as one when I am feeling generous. So take the extra blood points and you're welcome for the easy escape. The game has room for improvement, quite a bit of room to tell you the truth.

Diplomacy is actually viable now and you can win campaigns with it alone.  

The battles are fun and look great.  

Units have formations that are both useful and aesthetically pleasing.  

Army composition has been reworked to the retinue system which I like very much.  So armies now can have 3 generals each that can recruit certain types of units that are color coordinated to match each general.  This allows for buffs for said units from said generals.  It's a very pleasant addtion to the game.

Army supplies have been added so enemy armies can't just roam your lands for the entire campaign.

Good amount of different modes to play and all seem to work quite well from my experience, these days like to just start deathmatch with music on and pewpew or stabstab few games through and then do something else.

	[td] + Vast amounts of unique loots.
+ Well done gunplay, very much improved from BL2.
+ Overhauled vehicles customization. No more generic presets, and you can now customize every part of your vehicle, affecting both functionality and appearance.
+ Respawning doesn't reset world progress.
- Invisible walls blocking vehicle access to certain paths.
- Can't use vehicle as a platform.
- Why the fuck can't I quit and have my my progress saved in the Circle of Slaughter?

	[td]Content[/td]
	[td]10[/td]
[td]
+ In-depth progression system. Multiple skill trees, leveling up, increasingly powerful loot, endgame character upgrades and obtaining vehicle parts to customize your vehicles. All these and makes it obvious that you are getting more powerful in many different forms, no matter how long you play.
+ 4 different characters to choose from.
+ High replayability with new difficulties offering new challenges and rewards.
+ Regular new events.
+ Additional challenge arenas provides endgame content.
[/td]
[/tr]
[tr]
	[td][/td]
	[td]Artificial Intelligence[/td]
	[td]8[/td]
	[td] + A lot more natural behaviours with the enemy AIs as they now actually reacts to damage. They fall down, ragdoll, and even explode into a pile of gore when hit by guns or crushed by cars.
- Allies just looks so dead outside of cutscenes.
- While enemies have distinct groups, there aren’t much changes within each group, other than health, size and appearance.
- Fuck the Varkids. They just look so disgusting.

	[td]User Interface[/td]
	[td]4[/td]
	[td] + Liked the font in the game.
- Can’t sort your guns by the time of acquire, which is detrimental given how much loot you are given.
- Ui sometimes are unresponsive and ammo count and skill cooldown may go missing.
- Tooltips are confusing, you can’t expect me to just read the stats below and know that’s means amp? 
- Why not just say reduce cooldown instead of saying increase action skill cooldown rate? 
- Radius of Nova Blasts missing, something present in BL2.
- Inefficient weapons selling page. Half of the screen is dedicated to the redundant vending machine, and only around 20% of your screen shows your inventory.
- If I haven’t unlocked the area that the mission takes place in, then tell me so. Why do you have to put the marker in such a confusing way?
- Why not put names of locations you’ve discovered in the map?
- Loading screen tips gives you tips to all characters but the one you are using.
[/td]

	[td][/td]
	[td]Bugs[/td]
	[td]3[/td]
	[td]- Some ""explorable"" areas aren't really explorable, and some areas remain marked as unexplored even though you've explored them.
- Encountered a mission critical character falling off the map and I couldn’t proceed.
- Numerous UI bugs.
- Vehicle loadouts no longer saves and you have to reconfigure the vehicle you last used.
- Patches broke things like the vehicle loadout and used to break achievements.
- Some achievements are still broken.[/td]

	[td]- Steering with mouse bullshit in 2019. Who the fuck likes that? And why is the option to change that hidden inside the controller setting?
- Atrocious map navigation. Can’t pan around freely, having to zoom in and out and deal with rotation lock when viewing places of higher/lower altitude.
- Sometimes you will accidentally fast travel when you just want to drag the map around because of how fucking stupid the UI works together with the control.

	[td]8[/td]
	[td]Generally, it is a greatly improved game when compared to Borderlands 2. While I liked the new improvements made to the Gunplay, World Diversity, Progression, AI and Vehicle Customization, I can't help but feel the game's outdated and disappointing, mainly in the UI and the Bugs. However, the core gameplay is still very fun even with these shortcomings, and the game is still constantly being supported. Do note that the core gameplay is very similar to previous games with some improvements. So, if you don’t like the previous games, you probably won’t like this entry either.[/td]

The storyline, even though it's very hard to decipher what is happening sometimes, is very intricate and deep. The bosses were challenging, however never impossible (special thanks to the Weaversong Charm to aid me in the very frustrating Watcher Knights battle) and even the reward of satisfaction was all I needed sometimes in this game, because you will die. A lot (this is still a complete understatement). The bosses would sometimes take me hours on end, but I wouldn't have that patience to sit around and learn the attack patterns of these opponents if it wasn't due to the spectacularly befitting music. Now the NPC's, In my personal experience, a lot of the characters managed to make me grow attached to them, until they inevitably meet their end (in a good or bad way) making me experience a somewhat depressing state of mind for them, as you see their backstory unfold and finish in an instant. All in all, the final boss fight was exciting, however left me thinking 'is that it?' when I did eventually beat the Radiance. Maybe it's because Nightmare King Grimm was exceptionally hard and honed my Hollow Knight skills and made the final boss fight for the main storyline easier, but still satisfied me.

As a sidenote I would like to point out this game is quite a bit more linear than the classics like Mario64 and Banjo & Kazooie. You generally pick a mission and go at it.

736794,620,Portal 2,60493387,english,"I love this game. Not only for the story or puzzles, but for the witty insults the intercom blares every once and a while. Although the series left on a good note (I.E you leaving the facility after god knows how long) the fan base nearly requires another game. The stipulation was that valve can't count to three- and they have held true to that with all but one series- the half life series. But not only does the fan base's heart ache for even one more comment by GLaDOS; this could be a major money-maker. So it makes serious sense to make another one. This review is not only for the people looking at the community tab for a confirmation that it's worth the money (which it so is) this is also for anyone involved with valve. This says I have only played 44 hours, but I have 135 hours on my old computer. And I have enjoyed every second of it. Although this appears as just another puzzle game- if you take a completionist approach to this game; you will see the major attention to detail. And either it is a long time coming- or the third one hasn't even started. But the amazing shtick that took two entire games to cultivate would simply keep the ball rolling. This is an amazing game with graphics, ominous moments and humor that no modern game that I have seen even gets close to rivaling. And that experience is dirt cheap. This is an older game, but with an amazing team behind it. Buy it- buy it for a friend- and leverage the makers to make another one. That is what I did. This is not an ad. This is simply a candid report on the experience that was (and hopefully still is) the portal series.

P.S I don't consider the lab game a continuation of the the portal series. That game features about 6 different   minigames and only the main menu and one minigame really gets the nostalgia for GLaDOS rolling.

1942138,381210,Dead by Daylight,55211070,english,"[ING] Version:

I state that this is not a genre that I play very often but in some cases ... I play it willingly, and in fact the case of Dead by Daylight, personally the simple but effective concept and the difficulty of the game is not too difficult (not too easy, it depends on the players you are playing in the game).

At first glance the game is a lot of fun (at the beginning it is a little scary but the tension even if after some games it fades a bit of anxiety there anyway), you start with the optics but this is a Survival Horror , the goal is to survive before being killed by the killer (5th player), or by the killer killing the survivors (the 4 opposing players) before they escape, either on one side or on the other is not easy but not impossible,

In DbD in addition I am convinced that the rules of ""The higher you level the more you are strong"" are not in force the player level is a sort of ""goal of your progress as a Killer or survived plus level increases the more you have the chance to get special points to buy new Killers or survivors (except for newer additions) to increase your gaming experience.

So I think the game is fun both alone and in company (if you have a close-knit group of 3 other friends playing on discord).

Recommended to buy it with discounts if you want to save something more on some DLC (not strictly necessary to buy them all in my opinion).

Update (11/27/2019):

The game is very nice and fun ... a bit frustrating to code as a killer the search for games is too long, but the new ""Battel Pass System"" introduced and very nice and allows you to make lots of points and get free cosmetics partly and premium if you buy the battel pass.

[ITA] Version:

Premetto che questo non è un genere che gioco molto spesso ma in alcuni casi...lo gioco volentieri, e il caso infatti di Dead by Daylight, personalmente il concept semplice ma efficace e la difficoltà di gioco non troppo difficile (neanche troppo facile , li dipende dai giocatori con cui ci si trova in partita).

A prima vista il gioco e molto divertente (all' inizio fa un pò paura ma la tensione anche se dopo un pò di partite si affievolisce un pò di ansia c'e comunque), partite con l'ottica che però questo e un Survival Horror, l'obiettivo e di sopravvivere prima che si venga ammazzati dal killer (5° giocatore), oppure dalla parte del killer ammazzare i sopravvissuti ( i 4 giocatori avversari) prima che scappano, sia da una parte che dall'altra giocare non e semplice ma non impossibile,

In DbD in oltre sono convinto che non vige la regole del ""Più sei alto di livello più sei forte"" no il livello giocatore è una sorta di ""traguardo dei tuoi progressi come Killer o sopravvissuto più aumenti di livello più hai possibilità di ottenere punti speciale per comprare nuovi Killer o sopravvissuti (eccetto le nuove aggiunte più recenti) per poter aumentare la tua esperienza di gioco.

Quindi io ritengo il gioco divertente sia da solo che in compagnia (se hai un gruppo affiatato di altri 3 amici che giocano su discord).

Consigliato comprarlo con gli sconti se si vuole risparmiare qualcosa in più su alcuni DLC (non strettamente necessario comprarli tutti a mio parere).

Aggiornamento (27/11/2019):

Il gioco e molto bello e divertente...un pò frustrante codare come killer la ricercha delle partite e troppo lunga, però il nuovo ""Sistema di Battel Pass"" introdotto e molto bello e permette di fare un sacco di punti e di ottenere cosmetici gratuiti in parte e premium se si compra il battel pass.",1569056890,1574857896,True,1,1,0.513513505458832,3,False,False,False,76561198058700800,216,45,34866,431,224,1610719200

As someone who played Harvest Moon a lot as a child, this game really hits a nostalgic spot for me while still introducing new features that has me coming back again and again. Depending on your mood, you can play this as a simple farming sim, a dating sim, or a roguelike (caves, particularly in the desert) - or, of course, all of the above at once. I love how there's a structure and a plot to this game - and the fact that if you're not in the mood for it, you don't have to interact with it. I'm a simple nb that just loves exploring the dungeons, checking up on my farm animals, and giving gifts to my SO, lol. Perhaps it's time for my character to branch out a bit more. :P

It's amazing visual FX gives the survival game a more distinctive look than others on the market, I understand this is alpha and are alot of bugs but so far it is playable and enjoyable.

From the range of emotions that the cannibals act as they see you as a threat or not, even though they will still eat your Ding Dong, they still only attack if you seem as a Major Threat or if you Oppose them(Not Always True :p )

Bugs/Things I'd like to be addressed:
1. It takes to many hits to kill the cannibals and they hit very hard, I died from 3 hits from one and took me 7-9 hits with an axe to kill one, whilst being bum raped by 2 other cannibals.
2.Sprinting Kills, Use it carefully ( Please Fix :3 )
3.More Weapons/Survival Items
4. Survival Book is not entirely working as some recipies are misleading, e.g The Log Cabin Says it requires 35 Logs and no. of sticks, but when you place it it says you need 82 logs, I was like dafuq? The book didn't say that.


These are the main things that need to addressed in my opinion, I understand it's in alpha and things are still being carried out, but if you could take these into immediate consideration, that will be most helpful.

The storyline is brilliant first of all along with all the individual characters and their different personalities, interaction with one another and realfeel emotions facial expressions of every character is really well done and sets this game apart in an exclusive class of its own, graphics second of all is wonderful and well balanced given that you have a powerfull graphics card like a gtx 1080ti or a gtx 1660ti or better to really enjoy it to the full not forgetting a big 32"" 2560 x 1440 144hz HDR monitor. The big open world is fascinating, the physics and attention to alot of detail makes the gameplay even more realistic like, when you play this game it really feels if you are part of the game and best of all in Geralt of Rivia's shoes. Last but not least, do not forget the in game music which compliments every scene and part of the game this makes it all the more unique and outstanding. 

Thank you CD Projekt Red for this astoundingly amazing game. You have really done an excellent job and created an RPG game totally exclusive!

Please wake up zombies and get your head out of the clouds and stop supporting this terrible company that takes advantage of fans and in depth lore masters. CDPR took George R R Martins work and simply took a steaming pile of shit all over it, why the fuck was this allowed. If I can quote H.P. Lovecraft ""I fear my enthusiasm flags when real work is demanded of me."" CDPR Loves the hype around this dolt of a game but never truly cared for the source material. 

First of the combat is a mix of WWF Wresting and West Side Story (Favourite Movie BTW, Check out my Blog for more on that). There is no point in even trying to use sigils that are complete shit just like this games boring ass plot, why the fuck doesn't any character respect the power of the Witcher's in the trash universe. Henry cavil portrayal is just wrong why is superman fighting griffon and not black adam. The stupid bitch with grey hair is a straight up chicken headed hussy, she can never think for herself and always relies on a man to help her just like women in today's society were men are hunter's and women are strictly for Caregiver roles.  

The One true ring Through line was just a waste of time all you did was mash M1 till your fucking heart stopped just like my DEAD DOGS LOLOLOLOLOLOL, I hated the little bitch. The underlining themes of social injustice is justice bizarre for a game of the genre, I mean why was the mention of the 1% and fat cat capitalists in a game about fighting orcs and fucking bitches  baby. 


In conclusion this game is for fucking losers who cannot beat real games like MGS3 the best game of all time. Once and JOKER all ways a JOKER

If you want a semi-casual co-op loot-light RPG-light dungeon crawler with intense combat mechanics, get it.

Pros: 
+ highly satisfying combat: meat-salad/explosive/fire destructionation of hundreds of hapless enemies with any weapon you desire
+ brutally punishing on higher difficulties if you can't do good mechanics (e.g. dodging, aiming, etc.) and teamwork but
+ fairly forgiving on lower difficulties if you are a bit of a fight potato
+ some hilarious conversations /voicelines /banter /corpse physics
+ pretty decent graphics /sound fx
+ most players are not jerks and will help/show you stuff
+ a very DARK gory theme

Cons:
- loot is RNG but like, really bad RNG. (fuck you Ranald and fuck you reroll button), and so is crafting (also shallow)
- Player skill and attitude varies widely (this is not on the game, but still)
- progression is pretty shallow: after a while you have nothing to get (300 item and 600 character power is max) except skins which are stupidly rare
- not all careers are balanced and not all talents are balanced - you *can* play whatever combination you want and probably still win... or just do zealot and faceroll the same things.",1556169236,1556169236,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198025363300,110,23,12009,0,11550,1571598555

This game is not for everyone. It's big, it's complicated and it's sometimes comparable to actual work. You start off mining resources by hand, only to create tools which lets you mine resources and craft tools automatically.

It's incredibly polished, very optimized, has online multiplayer and it's a good price compared to the hours you'll get out of it.

It's a really nice game and in the end i still can recommend it (especially on sales) to everyone who can forgive imperfection in detail.

You can double jump, dodge, charge your spear to increase damage and range, have a flaming sword (with increased damage compared to the standard sword) and, the most amazing thing: you are a viking.

On the other hand:
- you have to press a movement-direction-button (left or right) with your second jump, because you jump straight upward without a direction-button.
- you can't move while crouching, so you have to dodge instead.
- after beating a stage and restarting the game, you have to visit all previous stages and move to the left in order to come to the next stage. There is no way to just choose the stage.
- you have to beat a stage in his normal version again in order to come to the harder versions of the stages. Also means there is no harder version of stage 1.

A limited branch of quests that could be a regular monster fight, a mini-boss fight, a chance to rest where you can either gain health back OR upgrade a card in your deck.  Visiting a merchant to buy various wares all at a steep price.  And finally a random quest where often times you'll be given various options on how to respond which can be painful but profitable.

  And if you're health reaches zero before hitting the boss at the end of the level...well you loose everything.   Every time you die you lose everything.  But that's okay, because you learn your enemies, you learn your characters deck (there are 3 different characters to choose from as of this writing) and hopefully you'll get a bit better RNG.  

If you like Card Crawl, deck builders, or Hand of Fate then you'll feel like you've made a solid purchase (please please please put this on ios!  To be honest I'd probablhy buy it twice).",1530685327,1531448523,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True,76561198034216000,91,8,6677,0,4683,1565557611

In more detail, the enjoyable parts are the fun writing, the great art, the ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE MUSIC, the wonderful boss fights and the platforming which manages to make a platforming casual like myself to not throw his controller while yelling.

Oh wait hang on, that's everything about it that's enjoyable, isn't it? By and large, yes. There are a few parts that could be criticized, though, mostly that the game lacks a bit of polish here and there in the actual platforming that makes up most of the levels. The game sometimes doesn't want to grab ledges, a few jumps are punishingly pixel-perfect(though really only a few) and the game sometimes helps you, sometimes ignores you and lets you plummet to your doom. Conversely, the boss fights are all amazingly well-done.

It's like someone inverted Shantae, which has tons of mood and good writing and art, well-polished actual levels, and then kind of hits its head and waddles around in confusion when you say ""boss fight."" Hat In Time, on the other hand, could've done with about another 500 boss fights without boring me, while I could see a few places to tighten up the levels themselves.

It's also a bit short on content, about 12 hours of play for me, which involved just toodling around Mafia Town for about an hour because I was enjoying jumping on things, wearing hats and listening to the music. But supposedly we're getting another two acts in the start of 2018, so I think that's a bit of a minor thing to pick on. Besides, 12 hours of very solid entertainment is good value for money considering that it's a game with essentially no random generation at all, everything about it being hand-crafted.

I'd say that the SubCon Forest and Dead Bird Studio both feel like they could've had another couple of stages in there, though. But if I had to choose, I'd rather that they stopped while I wanted more and felt like they could've done more, rather than another eight stages down the road where I groaned every time I saw the Conductor or DJ Grooves(not the Snatcher, though, good luck ever making me tired of him, nerds.).

Ultimately I'd give it a 9 out of 10. It would've been 11 out of 10, but I have to subtract two points for the ending. Very minor spoilers ahoy.

[spoiler]Losing one point because I wanted to sign another contract, and losing one point because I wanted to make another movie![/spoiler]

Adding an additional comment, I've revisited the game a number of times since my initial comment to see how the updates may have improved performance. While the crashes are a bit less frequent, each save (and autosave) takes 3-5 minutes instead of the previous 10 seconds or so. Since the autosaves are so frequent, I'd say its a net loss in time.

3772866,427520,Factorio,73992697,english,"The game is downright addictive. Build up, build out, make it faster, make it better. If you enjoy puzzles, logical planning, and occasional disaster it'll be the game for you. Just remember when you have your sprawling megafactory that can produce anything you need in seconds with robots to deliver it all to you that you started out scrabbling at rocks with a pickaxe. When you can rain death on your enemies from miles away and wreck the survivors with atomic hate and flamethrowers that you started with a pistol and ten magazines.

Pros:
+Requires you to constantly be thinking several moves ahead to build up your best base.
+Almost limitless creativity to design and improve your factory to build it better and faster.
+Changing map settings can alter the entire experience causing it to take a while for the game to feel stale.
+Largely polished as we approach the 1.0 release; no major bugs in vanilla play.
+The gameplay is very intuitive once you've gotten the hang of basic controls.
+Tech progression is smooth and feels rewarding as you progress.

Cons:
-The combat element is rather bland and can be automated like any other aspect of gameplay.
-While bland, you do not realize you're losing combat until 20 hours in due to the way the enemies advance.
-Some hard stops in tech progression where the thing that would expedite getting tech requires said tech.

Misc:
*Sometimes it can be fun to just watch your factory work. Remember, work smarter not harder.
*Flamethrowers are my favorite weapon. They are also the weapon I've killed myself with the most.
*Learning how to make trains work well is a fine art. Study real rail systems if you need help.
*[spoiler] Heavy Forests make it easier to get hard achievements. Once you have robots they don't impede you. [/spoiler] 
*[spoiler] The devs seem obsessed with complicated belt systems but they aren't really needed. [/spoiler]

A game that heavily symbolizes anxiety and depression, makes my mood go up whenever I'm feeling low. A game with soothingly tough difficulty especially with the B side and C side levels, there's far more to do after you finish the story mode. There's a whole lot of game to this, and it feels like the devs just want me to keep playing. Few games have made me want to go back to previous levels and collect all of the items, but luckily, the strawberries you collect tally into how well of an ending you get with the strawberry pie that Madeline makes for everyone at the end, and the hearts you collect allow for more levels until you finish all of the C sides. After you beat the story mode, it becomes a real collectathon. It's like the real game begins, similar to how it is with the 3D platforming Mario games.

In terms of difficulty, this is a tough one for completionists, but I love every second of the greulling climb. It always makes me feel better somehow. I'm not even close to finished, and I keep coming back.

Pros:
-Gameplay is excellent
-Graphics are fantastic
-Sound is used impeccably well
-Music is fitting and helps produce a lot of tension and atmosphere
-Solid atmosphere makes the whole game feel very immersive
-Interesting Story
-Fun base building
-Multiple vehicles with perfect progression
-Beautifully hand-crafted world that is both big enough and detailed enough, with a diverse set of biomes
-An array of awesome mods that can bring the game to yet another level of fun
-Multiple game modes to suite different kinds of players.
-Important loot is mostly randomized, so you can't just cheap out and look it up on a wiki, you have to genuinely explore the world.
-An Early Access game that was successfully finished!

Cons:
-Some aspects of the game are too easy in retrospect. (Mods can make this problem even worse, beware!)
-Sometimes quite buggy, but nothing game-breaking

I am not going to go highly in depth with the game but keeping it short , this is one of the best early access experiences i have had with a game , UWE has done an exemplary job and i will 100% buy into their next early access .

That aside , the game is very well balanced , not too grindy but not too fast as well , i really got caught up in building my base and ended up with something way way way larger than i ever would need , exploring is really fun also from gathering metal salvage in the safe shalows go being stalked  by crazy predators while gathering uranium . Small , funny and also giant creatures populate the waters that you will discover and will definitely enjoy 100% of it . 

Overall i will give this game 9.5/10 , it would be a full 10 /10 if i could play with a friend , in my eyes only that could make Subnautica better . Not full multiplayer but some kind of CO-OP situationwhere i can bring a friend or two along for the ride .

The only thing that i felt passing through into the release was a little bit of lag when the game is loading stuff in , i highly doubt that its my pc but maybe .

3741267,367520,Hollow Knight,31169190,english,"""No mind to think. No will to break. No voice to cry suffering. Born of god and Void.""

Quite possibly my most favorite game of the year so far, Hollow Knight is simutaneously a lovely and hideous game that demands no prisoner but only souls. For a game that has the same cryptic writing and story delivering style of From Software's Souls series, it managed to break my heart not once but at least four times thanks to the ugly conclusions of various sidequests that made me feel like a hero at first. If you need to cut deep to open a path, so be it, just don't forget that you're not alone in this hellhole, and always expect the worst if you happen to care about... someone particularly.

Contributing to the emotional impact is the lovely hand drawn artstyle where even the most hideous creatures can look fluffy and cute while the divine ones can turn into monsters in a blink of an eye. Okay that's probably an exaggaration but the diversity and quality here is phenomenal, every single area in Hollow Knight has a distinct theme that makes the game itself a treat to look at and traverse through, from the fascinating greenhouse of death in Greenpath, the cold heart of royal fuckery in City of Tears, the bullshit claustrophobic ""WHY IS THIS PLACE SO NARROW AND WHERE'S THE FUCKING LIGHT"" feeling in Deepnest, or... yeah, that White Palace. Visual cues make sure you're never lost, from pieces of paper that lead you to the mapmaker, directional signs with an image of a bench or tram on it, or even some paths suddenly have visual distinct from other areas grow near it. Hollow Knight also doesn't lack melancholic tunes that sometimes make you feel hopeless and furious, but my most favorite moments must be that relief feeling when I hear Cornifer's humming across an area: We're heading the right way! We don't need to wander aimlessly anymore!

Smartly interconnected levels make backtracking less a chore and more meaningful, since you can easily pass on any path that you can't quite reach yet and come back later with any mobility ability. Any unexplored path, any unopened door, any dark deep hole can always contain something that's worth risking our lives for, even discovering a shortcut back to previous ares feels like a true accomplishment. Hollow Knight encourages you to explore as much as you want, how quick and far you progress throughout the game really depends on your own pace. Of course, there are some definitive narrative structure that needs you to be in a specific place to trigger and can feel scripted, but the rest of the game allows you to go wherever you want, do what you feel like you want to first, Metroidvania and Souls-style.

Control can be iffy at times with overly sensitive strafing but it doesn't take much time to get used to it. Combat relies on the visceral feel rather than stylish combos, the charms make up for lack of equipments by giving you different utility, defensive or offensive effects. The game's difficulty is on par with your typical Dark Souls game, you don't have heath bar and your ""health mask"" depletes as the amount of damage taken, every weak monster can kill you if you're not careful, every boss can make you bang your head against wall, but they all have telegraphed moves that can be used against themselves.

I still believe that Radiance was designed by Satan.

Overall if you don't mind a lot of bugs (( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)), don't mind to be heartbroken, don't hate the map system, don't mind backtracking, and deeply a masochist, then you would be foolish to pass on Hollow Knight. Science hasn't proved that playing this game will turn you hollow or not, but I can guarantee that 22 hours into the game made my skin thicker and controller grew some scars that I didn't regret giving it.",1492310541,1511660532,True,29,2,0.709078788757324,1,True,False,False,76561198030057100,1396,76,1871,0,1480,1579362194

It's one of the few games that, despite being a complete grind, is actually fun. It's repetitive, but that's okay because you are repeating the same fun actions over and over, and they still manage to be fun. Also, you can listen to music on the radio while you truck which is amazing!

272968,292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,49387172,english," I bought this game during the steam lunar sale for 300 rupees ( 4 dollars and 40 cents ) and i am seriously disappointed at myself for not buying it for the full price. I had previously played witcher 1 and 2 on my console and they were okay at best (6.5 for the first one because of somewhat of a unusual combat and a solid 7 for the 2nd one , liked the story but didnt quite like the linearity of the game ) and i absolutely had zero idea what i was going into since it was going to be the first open world RPG developed by CD project RED . I saw many reviews about the game and they all praised it and held it in high regard . unfortunately my pc was garbage at that time when this game came out so i completely let this game slip under my radar. when i actually started playing the game i was seriously shocked (in a good way) and dumbfounded that how can a game have so much content and that too good content. 

All the side missions are excellent and kinda necessary as there will be an epic fight during the final act of the game where you can ask all these characters to join you in the fight. the story is excellent . the soundtrack is excellent. There are absolutely no bugs (none that i have encountered) .the mission design is excellent. Nothing feels out of place here . plus there are 2 outstanding DLC s which open up 2 completely new locations with different enemies and different quests . you can invest 100 hours into this game easily and still you wont be bored and still there will be something in the game for you to do. 

TL;DR overall i really dont think a rating out of 10 will do justice to this masterpiece but if it has to be a rating system i would give it 10/10 . it is really a must have.

The PC version seems to have more than the console version, which is great as its keeping me well interested. Don't be fooled by the pixelated Art style of this game, its a gem to play, so relaxing and fun to play. 

You start off the game after inheriting your Grandfathers old farm land and, being sick of the city work-a-day life, go live on the farm to make a better life. You start off having a rather ratty looking patch of land and, as you level up in certain areas like farming and foraging, end up being able to turn the ratty land into a beautiful looking farm. You can grow vegetables (make sure you water them daily), go fishing, go mining or even get friendly with the locals, with a view to get married and start a family. You can even have a civil partnership and adopt children, which is great to see being included in games.

I'm finding it hard to fault this game but I do have one or two things to say in a negative direction. Firstly that your game will only save once you go to sleep, not great when you are halfway through a day and you need to stop for any reason. Secondly, I plugged some headphones in to listen to the game whilst the better half was on a phone call and when he was done I unplugged the headphones but the game sound would not come back. I restarted the game and everything was back to normal, but I lost half a days progress as referred to in my first little gripe.

Third 20 hours,

I get the hang of it, able to escape couple of times. Just have to deal with toxic community, but fortunately you will still meet up some good guys.

5130356,814380,Sekiro™: Shadows Die Twice,53294444,english,"A bit of a different experience to other stuff from Fromsoftware, but honestly has so pretty nice and fluid combat once you get going (usually hits you about 25% ish into the first playthrough of the game). It'll take a while to get used to though, especially coming from something like dark souls 3 as I frames are essentially gone, so you go from Rolling through everything to parrying everything. Story is honestly much easier to follow which was nice to see honestly but it didn't hold back on actually checking for story that might be hidden through eavesdropping and NPC interaction. Two complaints i do have however, is firstly that with the way progression and items are setup, if you're not trying to speed run the game, there is virtually no replayability to the game after the second playthrough, assuming you do the first 'Secret' ending on the first playthrough and shura on the second, as by this point you've seen every boss in the game and theres no real new ways to take them on after this, which personally has left me in limbo in actually finishing off this games achievements (requires 4 playthroughs) - Which compared to something like DS3, which i have at least 10 or 11 playthroughs completed of, just because theres so many more ways to tackle each boss. Secondly, theres a lot of mindless grinding to get more ninja arts and skills after even your second playthrough. While this did seem nice for replayability early on, you soon realize that a lot of these skills you missed, you missed because they are generally pretty bad and using the real high tier ones just feels like a waste since they also cost your ninja tool resource and all in all i honestly wish that you could have actually had these earlier in the game cycles, such that their effects might have been more useful.

I have now spent over 70 hours on this game's Singleplayer and Multiplayer and I can safely say that I am very pleased with the game.

The Singleplayer has a great storyline and it is overall just really fun to play. The ending was amazing and off the beaten path compared to the endings in all the previous titles which just made it that much greater.

The Multiplayer has been nothing but a smooth experience. For once the Multiplayer in a Call of Duty game is working smoothly if you have good internet and a good setup to run the game. There are no hitmarker issues and the balancing is a lot better than the last few entries. The movement system has also been refined for the better. The only Multiplayer issue I have found is that sometimes lobbies can take a while to start, however that is not enough to fault the game.

Infinity Ward has done a good job here by trying to learn from the mistakes made by Treyarch in Black Ops 3. I am pleased :)",1480237587,1480237587,True,2,1,0.504921019077301,0,True,False,False,76561198039256400,401,6,9082,0,3419,1498982329

High Ping No Swing.

Horses Tp round the map with riders so your getting hit from a guy who can clearly see you but on your screen he is flying to mars on his steed.

Weapons go RIGHT through people and this was not just once or twice i could handle that its every other swing you'll watch your sword/axe w.e pass right through the player model and no damage is given.

Executioner's sword swings faster than a one hand weapon (Broken) 

Spear shaft dose the same damage as the tip when stabbing. Making the point of the spear non existent and well pointless.(Broken)

People sitting on a catapult with endless ammo. (Broken)

The game has no way to even report people who may or are cheating.

Everyone looks at this game with rose glasses thinking ""oh its the next Chivalry"" people forget Chivalry was garbage full of bugs and only cheaters at the end so yes this game is the next Chivalry only it reached Chivalry's end point far sooner.

This game is fun even if your terrible at it, I got the hang of this game in a few hours and became a decent player. There is atleast one weapon that suits your style, thats how good the variety is. 

You can also use this game in GMod for access to some maps and items that are in CS:S, and allow some content from the steam workshop to work correctly. so thats 2 for 1. (if you own gmod that is).

Note: This game requires a decent amount of mechanical skill, so if your a newb to FPS games in general, then you might want to try something easier. I was previously skilled at other FPS games (I was at MLG level in some...), so thats why I found this game quite easy to get in to.

Please dont judge this game because its old or because there is no ADS in it, the game is really fun and I think if ADS was added it would ruin the game completely. No ADS means you actually have to crouch and use mechanical skill to get your gun to hit the target. Instead of this CoD thing where as soon as you ADS your gun becomes super accurate.


So, if your looking for a Challenge or a fun FPS game to play with friends or with others, or you are into the modding then id reccomend it. If your just getting into the FPS Genre of games, id suggest you go for something easier before you jump into CS:S.

And if you want to go eSports, then go for CS:GO. Thats where the eSports are centered around as far as I know. (even though that game requires less skill in general)

The game that was there was just too good to pass up, which is the thing that made it special.

The early points of the game weren't great, but once you got your skills and just hit that infinite progression and kept going- it was a great experience. The only roadblock from there was the lack of meaningful content. Factions, unique equipment, stories to tell, gadgets to find. These gadgets and new exploration tools presented in the beta combined with the gameplay loop of the old game is all that it would have taken to blow everyone out of the water.

It's not the case though. What we have is only content- static content that never changes. A whole world with cool things to explore, but with systems in place that do their best to make sure you don't enjoy it.

There are a lot of people that don't like Dead By Daylight because ""____ is so OP"", but these people can largely be ignored. They are simply salty because they need more practice (mad cuz bad).

There are a ton of bugs however, and the matchmaking isn't all that great. There is tons of content that is planned, not as much actually in the game yet. 

That kinda makes sense, because it's being ported to PS4 later.

But if that's the case, this game should really be in early access, because of the lack of polish at the current moment.

407518,292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,27427763,english,"Not really a need for another Positive review on this pile, but I'm going for it anyways.

Let me Preface this by saying that while I owned The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings before this game, The Witcher 3 was still my first real experience with the Series. 

POSITIVES:

>Graphics: This game has great visuals. Monsters are very detailed, from their dirty skin and fur, to their grotesque limbs, the bits of clothing or knicknacks that some of them have made for themselves. Detail is insane. Same goes for character models and armour. Every charcter from the peasants, to guards, to sorceresses, to Geralt and friends, all have wonderfully detailed designs. There are hundreds of different kinds of armour for Geralt too and they're all just as detailed and realistic. Landscapes are very realistic and detailed. Previously, Skyrim was my personal standard for Fantasy RPGs, and while Skyrim is still a fantastic OWRPG, something that distinguishes the Withcer from it is that this world feels so much more believable. Skyrim is very high fantasy - lots of very extreme climates, each very distinct. That's not bad, it's just different from the Witcher. Velen is a great example of what I mean. War-torn countryside dotted with marshes, farmland, and forests, scenes of battle - fields covered in corpses and ruined siege weapons, all being devoured by mud and necrophages. All are huge and expansive but somehow also very real and visceral. Velen FEELS like a medieval countryside in the midst of war. I found the world to be beyond immersive.The point I'm trying to make is that despite being fantasy, the graphics made the world feel incredibly believeable; one can't help but be totally engrossed by it.

>Story: Some argue TW3's story was a bit padded - longer than it needed to be. While not entirely a false claim -there were areas where the story could have progressed quicker- I wouldn't call this is a flaw. The game was long and took some time and effort. You won't have it done in 24 hours, but it's like finishing a good book. You feel refreshed and satisfied. Story itself was good; Not super unique but rewarding and at many points very well written. Characters were very relateable and plot made sense. The Sidequests really shined. A great example being the Family Matters quest you recieve soon after arriving in Velen. Some of the best voice acting and writing I've seen in a game. Many of the smaller npcs in fantasy games often feel forced. There aren't many moments were one is moved by a character's acting. The opposite is true of TW3. There are many times in this game where I found myself agape, near tears, or laughing. The game is good at moving you, not because of out-of-the-box or surprising writing, but mostly because of top-notch character performance.

>Sound/Soundtrack: Authentic, Gritty, Catchy, and Emotional music made this game extremely memorable. Even if you don't buy the game, give the soundtrack a listen. You won't regret it. As far as other in-game sounds, there isn't much else to say, aside from: They're great. The cities, the animals, inns, battle and monsters, weather - all top-notch design.

>Gameplay: I'll argue in a moment that this is probably the game's weakest aspect, but I'd like to comment on a few things CDPR did right. Combat is not NECISSARILY a button-mashing festival. It consits of strong attacks, fast attacks, dodges, rolls, and various other techniques. There are a number of different ways to approach attacking the same enemy. I like what they've tried to accomplish, in that combat has noteable variety to it. Making a tough monster easier by reading a bestiary entry on it for example is an aspect of gameplay I really enjoyed. There's also the whole matter of character skills and progression to account for, but the gist of that is that spending AP to tailor to your preferred play style, sword-fighting, magic focused, using alchemy, etc, is very worth consideration. Travel in general felt Pretty well done. You never felt like you could travel the world in a heartbeat, but you also didn't have to slave for hours to get where you needed to go.

NEGATIVES
<Bugs: While the game isn't super buggy on the whole, there are definitely some issues that were frustrating at times. The horse is a notable example, some of it's AI movements being.. off. Other bugs were few but they were there. Monster AI could be pretty glitchy at times, and quests would sometimes glitch out and a reload was required. A few times I found Geralt walking around on his knees four feet in the airand other misc movement and animation glitches. Again, none were particularily distracting, none were game breaking.

<Gameplay: While I like what CDPR was trying to do with combat, the controls weren't perfect, it could get kind of clunky at times. Controls weren't bad, but especially if you used k&m, they took some getting used to. Not as bad as previous games, but not perfect either. I used an Xbox controller. I highly recommend that to anyone playing this game. It really improved playability. Sometimes certain aspects, while not inheritly bad at all, got a little repetitive. Detective geralt for example (Witcher Senses). 

CONCLUSION: Get this game. I'm a stingy person, but I'd reccommend it even at full price. CDPR have made something to be proud of. TW3 deserves every bit of love it gets, because of the love the devs have given it. A true fantasy epic. 200 hours of genuine entertainment. 9.5/10 at least.",1480071973,1480071973,True,1,0,0.502487540245056,0,True,False,False,76561198079358900,187,2,14633,0,13661,1607760381

You get to know which tasks each one should do. You form systems for how to manage your base. You tame animals for their produce, you build workshops, and you start making an excess of supplies to sell. You start to build infrastructure that not only makes your base habitable, but also a rather decent for your colonists. You establish a great colony on the rimworld. 

This game is also brutal. Your colony of ten get raided by a band of fifteen raiders armed to the teeth. You somehow manage to fend them off, but the fight leaves many injured and a few dead. After you start treating to your colonists needs as best you can, another raiding party attacks out of retaliation for their lost. They prepare their siege with sandbags and mortars. You try and meet them head-on but are slowed because of past injuries. You fend them off with what you have left, but the damage to your base and your colonists are done. Your hydroponics system is destroyed and your food supply is engulfed in flames. Because you're in a desert and it's the heat of summer, there is no opportunity to plant anything to eat. The few colonists that you have left have little chance to survive, and eventually succumb to the heat and the hunger. Your colony had a good run, but it eventually is put to an end. ...Either this or your colonists get mauled to death by a bear after shooting it fifteen times.

The graphics are stellar, the way demons get ripped apart by gunfire is awesome to look at. The maps are more varied than the DOOM 2016, with different locales that genuinely look distinct and unique. Plus I only encountered one graphical error when part of my screen glitched out in one of the final missions.
The story is...there? Personally didn't keep track of the story that much so i can't really say anyhting on that front.
My only main dislike is a certain enemy type that is introced later on in the game. This certain enemy has a very small window in which you can attack him and his inclusion seems very much to go against the fast paced combat of doom, seeing as how towards the end of every fight it's juts this guy left and the pace grinds to a halt, which kinda sucks.

- Vehicle variety and customization
- Did I say Co-Op?

Cons:
- You will run into some problems with controlling vehicles when playing Co-Op with friends in other countries. 
- High rarity weapon drops are REALLY bad when there is not a Co-Op event running. (I can go an entire 4 hour game session with friends and only get mostly greens with maybe a couple of purples...yikes.)

This is mostly due to the increased number of assets added to the game, ranging from the new environments of White Forest and its surrounding countryside to the Antlion nest to especially the Hunters (or mini-striders as I once thought of them).  If I remember correctly it was also a period of change for Source as it provided an update to the engine, not to mention the reference to everyone's favorite teleportation-based puzzle game.

I like Episode 2, but I also have a love-hate relationship with it, simply because I, like so many others out there, have been waiting far too long for Episode 3.  I would really like to see an Episode 3...however with all the hype for Half Life 3 I feel like if Valve ever introduced an Episode 3 they'd likely start a World War 3.  In any case, this is a definitely satisfying closure to the current events of Half Life 2.

Pros:
- Good graphics 
- They did try to insert some interesting mechanics for each faction, too bad the game itself sucks.

Cons:
- Took the Unique mechanics of DOW 1 & 2 and threw them to the garbage, and yes, it does feel alot like ""Starcraft 2 / MOBA"" combination, the only thing though is that Starcraft 2 is actually good.

- Singleplayer is a waste of time, nothing close to the DOW 2 campaign or DOW 1, Multiplayer is LAGGY and unstable.

- Hero Units (OR elites) take a HUGE role like in a MOBA, while they used to be somewhat powerful and help you get advantages over the enemy in previous DOW games, in DOW 3 they can *ERASE* whole units in a second - nothing more fun than spending a few good minutes building units for  just to see them get wiped out immediatly.

- Simplified game mechanics - Say goodbye to Cool looking battlefields and destroyable covers, you now have Lanes, Stealth Zones and Cover ""ZONES"" that make perfect camping spots

- Building bases is back only for you to build 5 buildings and Boost up units with simple 'More DMG' / 'More HP' upgrades and some unique upgrades that are okay at best.

- A unique feature of DOW - Switching between Melee and Ranged combat, is almost non-existent in DOW 3 + no killing animations.

- Game released with only one mod, compared to the different mods and terms of DOW 1 (in a latest patch they add Destroy Base Mod - which pretty much was the goal in the first mod so... thanks?)

- Reduce the amount of races from 4 to 3 in order to add more units and create a better balance, only to achieve the same amount of units and NO balance, can't wait for the first faction they'll announce as DLC.

- Ridiculous low amount of maps, ONLY 2-3 for each type of match (1vs1, 2vs2, 3vs).

I played DOW since the first game in 2004, the only thing that the fans wanted was a good Balance between DOW 1 and 2, hell even a REMAKE of DOW 1 would be great, and and we all got shitted on by the developers that had a different plan in mind, probably to make DOW a Esports game like Starcraft, they fucked it up and now this game got a shitty score and it deserves that.

If you still want to try it, go for it.
However even if you want to buy it, know that you get way less content than you should get for a full price game, I suggest waiting for a Major disscount before you go ahead and buy it.",1493323999,1497798613,False,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,76561197996573800,234,43,1563,0,1495,1525394022

This game... it [i]shouldn't[/i] be fun, it's got all of the makings of everything boring. It's a game where you drive on the motorway to deliver stuff to warehouses. But it's [i]fun[/i]... 

Euro Truck Simulator 2 is sort of like being shown a 4D cube as a citizen of the 3D universe. It just baffles you. For starters, I haven't played the other ""simulator"" games like Train Simulator or Garbage Truck Simulator (seriously?), I bought this because something just compelled me to. Perhaps it appealed to my secret yearning to drive around Liverpool in a giant truck in the rain with my windscreen wipers on. It's a great simulation, the controls work brilliantly (though I had to tweek them a little to fit my preferences) and it recreates the roads of the world quite accurately (I assume, I only know the roads of North England). 

My only real gripe with the game is that it doesn't seem to actually simulate the cities of Europe. When I said you can drive around Liverpool, you can only really drive around the outskirts of the city. It's really a shame, but I suppose the game makers didn't have time to recreate the major cities of Europe.

1678132,8930,Sid Meier's Civilization V,17452868,english,"So Civilization had just finished installing. I decided I would play it for maybe half an hour just to see what it was like, as I had plans for that day. So I started my game as Rome, and I attempted to be very scientifically progressive and economically sound. I was very peaceful and most civs liked me.

Then the barbarians took my worker. I just payed quite a lot of gold to get that worker, so of course I was angry. I got my archer ready and killed the barbarian. Just as i was about to rescue them the Germans came in and took them for themselves. We had a declaration of friendship up until that point, where I immedietly denounced them. They in turn, built an army and moved it next to my borders.

At this point I realized I had to strike first. So I hit his forces and invaded Hamburg. Doing this made me seem like a warmonger and all other civs were hostile to me. I decided to wait until the atomic era to get atomic weapons to take them on. When I got there I stockpiled around 7-10 atomic weapons in one of my cities. Just as I was about to use them Ghandi invaded me and took my city. Soon he was fighting most of the world.

I had the second most powerful military in the game, so I saw it as my civic duty to stop Ghandi. As soon as I took one of his cities half of the world declared war on me. Fighting on both sides, I barely made it out of that mess, and soon there was no one to stand up to Ghandi.

Within turns Ghandi plowed through our capitals and won the game. This was sixteen hours after I started. Two lessons can be learned from this:
1. Don't get this game if you have and want to continue your social life
2. If Ghandi is in your game, just concede defeat now and prepare for a life as a slave

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
[list]
[*]Old-school pixel art graphics
[*]Cute and at the same time creepy design
[*]Atmospheric music
[*]Good sound design
[*]Easy controls
[*]Infinite replay value
[*]Lots to unlock which creates a feeling of progression
[*]Many diverse gamemodes, floors, rooms, enemies, bosses and items
[*]Mod support (With the second DLC the mod support is even better)
[*]Challenging achievements
[*]Local multiplayer
[*]Ok-Good DLCs
[/list]

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
[list]
[*]Not an easy game to get into
[*]Sometimes bad luck can screw you over
[*]Sometimes you get too lucky and become way too overpowered (which can be fun though)
[*]The game doesn't tell you about the effects of items (it doesn't really tell you anything)
[*]Some of the achievements are based on luck moreso than skill
[*]Some room layouts are bad
[*]Certain unlocks are locked behind extremely difficult achievements
[/list]

[h1]Advice:[/h1]
Knowledge about all of the items and enemies is key. I suggest looking up item effects on the fly on this website:
www.platinumgod.co.uk
This will make your life much easier.

The very weird carry limitations makes no sense you can only carry a small amount of each meat type. Like only 3 small meat max but can also carry 3 rabbits, 3 lizards some medium sized meat chunks and some fish all at once. You can't carry any cooked meat at all. The limitations on non food items were plenty enough that it didn't hinder.

The time flow rate feels off, food goes off way too fast and you can't travel or explore much without becoming hungry and thirsty.

Building is nice and easy but mainly only did so to create a save point and to mark cave entrances. Its annoying destroying structures doesn't give any resources back.

The map once finally found was rather useless as its blank and you get to fill it in as you go. In multiplayer it was very annoying for the map to reset to blank on death. I don't know why it couldn't of been drawn in the survival book you get at the beginning to save either looking up the location or chance upon finding the map.

 I wish there was a face mask as its always so blurry going underwater. The rebreather only gives you air and a light which comes in handy in the dark waters.

The animals are fun to chase after but there is an annoying de-spawn distance. I have seen many deer disappear that I have been chasing and shooting with arrows while having clear sight of them. Would also have been nice for large animals to give bones.

I enjoyed the crafting system but didn't like that every time I wanted to create multiple items I would have to put all ingredients individually together each time and remove the item just created. I did find adding many feathers to a weapon made it look funny.

The main story is rather vague with only some photo's, drawings, notes, tapes and videos that didn't give any hint at all what is going on with this weird area.

PROS:
-Extremely easy to run (It's running on an engine over 11 years old)
-Though the graphics are showing age, they are high standards if compared to a 7th generation console
-VERY active modding community keeps the game alive (I'll go into more detail on this later. Scroll down if you wish)
-Variety of fun and addicting gamemodes, which are still growing in numbers
-Player hosted servers (Which is a good thing when you have a lot of them)
-A good portion of the community is unserious and goofy, which can be very fun at times
-It allows you to pull some content from other Source games (Half Life series, CSS/CSGO, Portal, TF2, etc.)
-Playable on all the major computer operating systems
-Plenty of servers

CONS:
-Is one of those games that steam won't recognize as closed for a while
-Some of the community is pretty taint, and either hate younger players, or take things way too seriously
-Some bugs after updates, though they get patched within a week, usually
-Without Counter Strike: Source, you'll be missing a lot of content for popular communtiy maps, so you'll get a bright purple checkerboard instead, or an error sign

MODDING:
This is where the game really shines the brightest. The game's modding capabilities seem almost limitless, and with the Steam workshop you can get a mod with the click of your mouse and some download time. Making a map is simple, and familiar to anyone who has made maps for the Source or Goldsource engines. I haven't gotten any deeper in modding than maps, so I have no idea how hard it is to make those.

The biggest part of the modding has to be the gamemodes. Modders can make entire gamemodes from scratch. These include a lot of well known gamemodes (Due to YouTube popularity) such as Trouble in Terrorist Town (An addicting murder mystery game. Make sure you have Counter Strike: Source for this one, unless you choose to play MC themed maps,) prop hunt (You don't always need CSS for this one, but you'll want it,) DarkRP (It's taken seriously by many but when you get a group of unserious people it's a blast,) and many more gamemodes.

This game basically entails you starting out with a butter knife, and collecting loot to better equip yourself. You have to manage your food and water so that you can survive. There is an XP system which allows you to level up your character and aquire perks to make your survival easier, or easier to hunt and kill the ""zombie"" in this game known as nether, or easier to hunt and kill other players. The main types of loot you'll find are sellable items, health recovery items, food/water, ammo, and guns or gun parts to craft your own weapon.

That is the main goal of the game, to survive and thrive. Now the thing that wards players off from these types of games is permadeath. I wasn't a fan of this game for the longest time until I noticed that they added something pretty neat. Along with your character level, there is an account level. This level will not be lost on death, and when it is leveled up, you will get perks that accumulate and are there everytime you play, even if you die. The perks can be very useful, like more cash everytime you spawn, more health, more carry weight, and I'm not very far in the levels yet. I really think this is a great feature, because even when I die I don't feel like I've wasted all those hours on that character just to get shot.

Just a few more features that I would like to add which I appreciate are taunts, from flipping off the world, to dancing on corpses. Character customizations, with different outfits and hats and masks (There's a Deadpool mask too) which all can be bought with real or ingame currency, and stay with you no matter how many times you die. A balanced loot system in which loot isn't impossible, and it isn't around every corner.

Short review format:
-Predetermined character RPG at its core, cinematic AAA title in its graphics and story play.
-Excellent story development at the expense of limited character customization (a well implemented, intentional choice by the developer).
-Graphics 10/10
-Sound 10/10
-Gameplay 9/10 (Balance in sword vs. signs is strongly magic biased, strong sword style is draconian, so most swordplay is fast style twirling through mobs, albeit a minor opinion.  )
-Story\Quests 10/10 (really wish there was a better way to highlight the gap between most current game's lackluster writing and the Witcher 3's order of magnitude of improvement in writing... out of scale here to be honest)

Stardew Valley is amazing.  It is tremendous.  It fills me with glee and delight.  I have built spreadsheets to calculate maximum crop effeciency not because I need to (it's so easy to get in to you guys) but because I enjoy playing the game even when I am not playing the game.

[h1]Sounds[/h1]
So, do you remember the really trash audio when it comes to footsteps and directions that the first Insurgency game had? Well, surprise! It's even worse in this sequel. Even if you are ALL alone in a little grass tile and completely still it'll still be making grass-footsteps noise which then take about 10 seconds to completely vanish. Heard an enemy coming from the right and now you are aiming there? Surprise! He's actually on your middle-left side and now you are dead! Ah just like the good ol' days! 
[i]I have a HyperX Cloud Revolver headset which works amazing in all other games where they have proper sound direction, not a case for this game[/i]

The guns and explosions and everything else have an amazing brand-new sound! So I guess it's a pro?

[h1] Performance [/h1]
Straight up shitty! You'll constantly see textures reloading/loading when you get to a new place fast, but it runs at 60fps with no problem, just the performance regarding texture loading really sucks.

[h1] Bugs [/h1]
This is a unreal engine game and as you can expect it's full of bugs, countless are the times I've seen someone running in T-Pose or getting sucked whilst in T-Pose into the ground (Remember it's only a 34 minutes gameplay, I imagine that once you reach 100 hours on this game you get a Quality Assurance diploma.

[h1] Community [/h1]
Still no one uses VOIP and 'member campers? Yeah, they are back!

[h1] Maps [/h1]

Oh jesus this isn't Call of duty? I thought it was. They are all soooo tiny, nothing like the older insurgency game, and full of corridors, just like in Call of duty yeah, you can literally RUSH in this game and expect to get at least 3-4 kills.

I'm refunding this and going back to good ol' Insurgency 1 and Arma III.

Overall, there is a lot to like about this game. I've only encountered one (annoying) bug and that could have been fixed if the devs had just given us some more usable console commands to work with (sadly they don't seem ot have done that). But overall the game is extremely fun and engaging as well as challenging and is a top-notch survival game.

Pros
+ incredible graphics even on a mid-high laptop.
+ great sound
+ immersive gameplay
+ surprisnigly interesting story for a survival game
+ very user-friendly UI and game control system
+ realistic underwater physics and alien biology
+ open world

Cons
- waypoints are sometimes buggy (turned off, they sometimes still appear, and vice versa)
- if you get a vehicle stuck on an outrcop/land, it's done -- there's no way to get it off
- resource balance seems a bit off -- I have a glut of some and hardly any of others
- no 3rd person view, no way to zoom in/out w/camera

There's so many little things to it, from the cringy writing, awful camera, lack of any story or context, rage inducing enemies and mechanics, and so many more little things that make this game a game you love to hate. It's so stupid and pointless, that I probably won't bother playing it again.

I never completed it because I got too fed up with it. It's a game I tried to force myself to finish so I can write this review with proper knowledge, but I couldn't bother. It's a bad game, bottom line.

[h1]Positives[/h1]
[list]
[*][b]Good customization of your character and weapons.[/b] You can customize nearly everything about your character, from your armor, to your weapon, to the camo of everything.
[*][b]Good graphics.[/b] They won't make you immediately vomit when you see them. They are rather decent graphics.
[/list]

[h1]Negatives[/h1]
[list]
[*][b]Horrible camera.[/b] The third person camera sucks. It's right behind your shoulder and the FOV is low, so 1/3 of the screen is your guy, while the rest is your view, but it's so zoomed in that it makes it super annoying to play. You can't see if anything is 2 feet to your left or right. It's so rage inducing.
[*][b]Bad optimization.[/b] Despite good graphics, the optimization sucks. You get lag spikes and stutters, even on the lowest settings. While it isn't as bad as Ark or GTA IV, it's not good either, and you will notice it in game.
[*][b]Rage-inducing enemies.[/b] There's special zombies that swallow an entire clip of headshots or multiple melee hits with your Brainer (scythe-like melee weapon) while they can two hit you. That doesn't mention all the other zombies, dogs, and crows (Yes, crows attack you in this game from above and they're hard to kill with the horrible camera) sprinting towards you and attacking you from all directions!
[*][b]Rage-inducing gameplay.[/b]That also doesn't mention the 5 foot circle you have to stand in for 10 seconds to complete the mission objective, and this circle is so easy to step out of because you're trying to back away from the horde of zombies coming at you, stopping the 10 second timer and wasting time. The Brainer also has a full damage attack, but this attack has a 2-3 second animation to kill one enemy, where enemies can hit you but you can't hit back, and you need to use this attack to kill the special zombies quickly! It's so frustrating!
[*][b]Repetitive singleplayer campaign.[/b] There's literally three kinds of missions in this game: collect DNA samples, stand in the 5 foot circle for 10 seconds 5 times, or collect briefcases laying around the maps. That's it, and the game will repeat the same concept over and over and over. You'll go crazy doing the same mission over and over again.
[*][b]Stupid writing.[/b] It's painfully cliche and unoriginal writing. It's like the guy who wrote everything for this game never wrote anything worthwhile before in his life.
[*][b]Claustrophobic maps.[/b] The maps, both single and multiplayer, are tiny maps with narrow corridors. Couple this with the horrible low FOV shoulder camera, and it's not an enjoyable experience.
[*][b]Dead community.[/b] Even from day one, there's not much of a multiplayer community playing this game. There's a recent influx of new players because the game is $1 on Humble Bundle right now, but that'll die out soon.
[/list]

3903938,294100,RimWorld,54670599,english,"Lots of people compare this game with Factorio (which I love), so I thought I'd give it a try.

It has an addictive aspect, because there is always ""one more thing"" to do, and I binged played it for 20 hours. But my overall impression is still bad.

The graphics are... well, like Prison Architect. Definitely not my favorite.

The difficulty is fine, but some errors punish you long after you do them. Mostly managing quantities (and you can't know what you are going to need until you have played). So it is easy to run out of food, since it takes a long time to grow. You can also run out of components, which are crucial for all mid-late game tech, which may force you to trade.

The game is... well, auto generated... it seems to me like it is always the same... ok, not an enraged rat but an enraged mufalo this time... whatever. Raiders, always raiders. Caravan. Meteorite. Capsule... again, and again, and again.

Sometimes it gets very boring, because everyone is sleeping, and you can't go faster than 3x the speed, so you should probably watch Netflix while you play. I don't think that's a good point for the game.


My main issue though, is that you keep on fighting with the game:

The characters have an AI, but they are dumb as luck, so you have to keep on micro-managing them, ""The Sims"" like. And sometimes they'll just do what you prioritized once, and go back to their stupid idea. This could be kind of ok if the UI was very simple and intuitive but:

The interface needs a complete rewrite. A few example : 
[list]
[*] If you want to restrict items to store in a zone, you have to select the zone, which shows a panel with nearly nothing, click a small button, which allows you to select the kinds of items, in a tree list organized by category. You can't search for the kind of item. So you spend 5 minutes trying to guess in which category it should be. For example, the plant ""Ambrosia"", is not in the plants (or something like that), but in the drug category.
[*] Asking to build items is... not complicated, but tedious too. So many clicks for something that should be easy considering how often you are going to do it.
[*] You can deconstruct placeable items, but not clothes and weapons, so you end up with a shit load of ""storage"" zones filled with useless clutter. Or understand that caravans are your trash and sell everything they will accept to them.
[*] Making caravans to trade... you would think an easy workflow like: select the destination, click go, select your people, their loot, et voila. NO. You have to click on your base. Then click a button ""Caravan"". Then choose people, and their items. You don't know yet how long it will take, but choose their food. Then click the ""Accept"" button. Which does nothing but tell you ""You have to select a route"". So click the ""Select a route"" button, select the destination... now you are back to the previous panel, so change your food, and click ""Accept"". And of course, ""Accept"" is on the left of ""Select a route"" button, so it's not even in a sensical order.
[*] Trading is non-optional. Some vital items (like components, or medecine), or either too slow to build, or just can't be created.
[*] There is a color code by faction on the world map, a more useful color code would be by friendliness, since you're going to be sending traders to friends, and attackers to ennemies. Using ""green"" to show ennemy camps is counter-intuitive.
[/list]

Basically, it violates every rule of User experience 101. The things that are going to be done frequently should be very easy to do. Icons should be used whenever possible to identify quickly (items for example, instead of text lists). Search is good to find something in long lists. Relevant info should be shown immediately (like what is required to build an item, what skill it uses, for example).

The servers in the huge majority of the world are fine, progression is amazing, build variety is huge. Combat is fluid and the netcode behind all of this is nothing short of black magic. How many games have realtime sword clashing without cutting into a QTE?

A lot of the reviews cry about how there's no skill in this game, which is a wild assumption. Follow a skilled player around and they will dominate in every single server they go into. If there is no skill, how is that possible? What the people saying ""There is no skill"" mean, is that they want to control the lobby. In a 24v24/32v32 game, they want to be able to singlehandedly turn the tide. Sure, the best players can carry the weight of 5-6 men all on their own but that's still only 5-6. A team which is overall worse is going to suffer and probably lose, yeah. Every >team< game works this way.

I'm not above shaming, so here's an excerpt of the kind of review I'm trashing with my own commentary in brackets. This one is written by ""Ser Matokovich"".
______________________________________________________________________________________________

The Executioner's Sword: Hitbox is far too large ... Same issue as was in Chivalry, where players will turn their heads in another direction and the sword will tap your shoulder with the tip and instant kill you as he faces away from you. (PS this was never a sword used in combat anyway, the fact it is in this game is nonsensical)

-[Realism shouldn't be your target here, while we're at it should swords and slashing weapons do 0 damage to plate armor? Should bows deflect off of armor? No, ultra-realism isn't fun but hitting people with a lute sure is. Punching fully armored knights is fun too. Moving on from that, what you're referring to is called ""Dragging"" and is a mechanic the game's tutorial teaches you about. It's not a mechanic exclusive to the executioner's sword, every single weapon in the game can do it, including weapons with FAR larger hitboxes like spears, zweihanders, and halberds. What you are proposing is to remove a skill based mechanic from the game. No. Also this is the shortest greatsword in the game so if you have a range problem you must be living in a different universe than I am.]

The Maul: same as executioner's sword, but can be rapidly feignted to a far more comical level of abuse.

-[The maul is already weak in many ways, it's a gimmick weapon and you are falling for it by being so unable to adapt. It has a very, very short length of 60cm. It's the only weapon in the game with a 900ms recovery when you miss (Instead of 700ms), it has the slowest windup (725ms) which gives you over an entire full second to back away from the hit and counterattack. It's a VERY exploitable weapon.]

The Longbow: Consistent 2 shot kill on heavy armor, which WOULD be fine as longbows are the heaviest bow in game and cost many class points. However, Longbows only achieve killing power with its immense draw weight. In game, archers can draw longbows VERY quickly and hold their shots for VERY long periods of time, making the longbow extremely easy to abuse.

[Two headshots in a row is ""Easy to abuse""? Ranged weapons are currently very ""eh"" for this exact reason, it's three shots if you miss one of those two headshots, four if you hit the legs too. At any point, all the enemy has to do is hide behind a wall for 5 seconds and heal, starting it all over again. You only get a small pool of ammo and I doubt you can consistently land headshots from a safe distance with how people wildly move about in this game. Arrows take 2.2s to reload which is indeed unrealistic but not by any major amount. Once again I don't understand how realism affects the game in any way, are you saying you want to cap out at 10-12 arrows per minute?]",1558680610,1558680610,True,2,0,0.529667139053345,1,False,False,False,76561198072431800,193,31,5822,0,3865,1589616324

Life was simple, and they were both happy. That was until the day Isaac's mom heard a voice from above; 
""Your son has become corrupted by sin! He needs to be saved!"" 
""I will do my best to save him, my lord"" his mother replied, Rushing into Isaac's room, removing all that was evil from his life. 
Again, the voice called to her; ""Isaac's soul is still corrupt! He needs to be cut off from all that is evil in this world, and confess his sins!"" ""I will follow your instructions lord, I have faith in thee"" Isaac's mother replied, as she locked Isaac in his room, away from the evils of the world. 
One last time, Isaac's mom heard the voice of god calling to her; ""You've done as I've asked, but I still question your devotion to me. To prove your faith, I will ask one more thing of you"" 
""Yes lord, anything"" Isaac's mother begged. ""To prove your love and devotion, I require a sacrifice, your son Isaac will be this sacrifice. Go into his room, and end his life as an offering to me to prove you love me above all else"" 
""Yes lord"" she replied, grabbing a butcher's knife from the kitchen. 
Isaac, watching through a crack in his door, trembled in fear. 
Scrambling around his room to find a hiding place, he noticed a trap door to the basement, hidden under his rug. 
Without hesitation, he flung open the hatch, just as his mother burst through his door, and threw himself down, into the unknown depths below.

3252670,834910,ATLAS,47931291,english,"I know I'm one of the few people right now that is going to write a positive review, but I wanted to get it out there since I think there are reasons you should play Atlas if you like games like Ark (or just like Ark).  However, there are a few caveats to having a good experience, and mine is written from the perspective of someone who runs a private cluster, so the issues on the official servers do not impact me or my review.

The initial biggest source of complaints was the release delay, and after spending time on the Atlas Discord channel when the release was supposed to happen last Friday I immediately decided to write off all of those complaints.  Yes, the devs delayed the game.  Yes, they didn't tell people until after they missed the deadline more than once.  What I don't get is the toxicity in the community on this - no one put down a single penny, yet they were already screaming bloody murder.  As noted, delays happen, and while annoying, I'm not going to knock the game because of this.  If anything I believe the devs deserve a break considering the absolutely disgusting comments I was reading over and over in Discord.  In the end it's a game.

The second complaint once the game went live was issues connecting to the official servers.  I have always played Ark on private servers, and once I found out Atlas would allow private servers, that was the chosen path for me and my friends.  I pre-ordered some servers, and I did log into the official servers while I waited for them to be provisioned.  The servers were admittedly a dumpster fire.  Rubber banding, connection issues, flying mobs, people, you name it.  That is definitely a negative and I know issues have continued, but my private cluster was up and running a day post release, and we've been running non-stop on that cluster for about a week now.  We have experienced bugs of various types, some inherent to the game that have subsequently been  patched over the past week, others related to managing a server that has almost no documentation and is changing under our feet regularly.  However, the servers have been up and stable, and our group has 20-40 hours of game time per person with few issues.

I also have to remind people that this is an Early Access game.  I don't understand why this is lost on people, but when you purchase an Early Access game you sign up for bugs, issues, and all kinds of other problems.  From Steam's documentation ""Early Access is a place for games that are in a playable alpha or beta state, are worth the current value of the playable build, and that you plan to continue to develop for release.""  I don't know how many of you have done alpha or beta testing before, but games in those stages can be very rough.  I firmly believe this game is somewhere between Alpha and Beta, with the game itself being Beta (mechanics, graphics, etc.) and the server/MMO aspect being more Alpha.  For those playing on official servers that can't access the game at all you should definitely be eligible for a refund and it is a negative of this game.  

The second part of the documentation is an important one, ""... are worth the current value of the playable build.""  As of this writing I have 48 hours in game, with probably 40 or so actually play.  That calculates to a cost $0.63 / hour for entertainment.  If you can point me at anything that can provide 40 hours of entertainment for 63 cents, let me know and I'm all over it.  Most large AAA games target 40-60 hours of content.  I think the community has seemingly forgot that from a cost perspective, video gaming is completely cheap.  At this point I would say I've absolutely gotten $25 of value out of my experience, and as I continue to play the game the value just increases.  If you have 40-50 hours of gametime and you're complaining about how horrible this game is, you should probably stop spending 40-50 hours doing things you hate.

With all that being said, I absolutely recommend Atlas if you can go the private server route.  When you run your own server it allows you to compensate for some of the bugs.  For example, I read many threads related to ghost ships spawning absolutely everywhere and destroying a brigantine within the first two minutes of its maiden voyage to then find out the devs nerf the spawn rate by 60% because it was a bit much.  Considering it takes probably 100+ total hours of work to build a brigantine on an official server, I can see that causing a lot of cursing.  

On a private server it's a different story because you can spawn the mats and quickly re-build that ship.  Is it cheating?  Technically yes, but the issue that caused you to lose the ship in the first place was a balancing / spawning issue that should've never happened.  I believe correctly that with a few admin commands gets you back to an state where the game is enjoyable, and you can move on with trying out other aspects of the game instead of farming 24/7.

So again, Atlas is definitely rough.  If you are trying to play on official servers I would not recommend this game.  However, if you're willing to spend $13/month for a private server, it's absolutely worth it and can be a ton of fun, especially once you get into the later content.  And yes, there are dragons :)",1546103820,1546104468,True,5,2,0.473936468362808,0,True,False,True,76561198008081900,74,3,4550,0,4550,1546669544

Only complaint is that the inventory grid is different when you're at a shop as opposed to elsewhere... which causes stuff to bounce around.

As everything else it's not perfect (it has some flaws here and there), but I'm not going to mention them because if you don't know about it you won't find it.

The quests are well structured, no secondary quest is boring. The story too is well done. One important thing to mention is that everything is related to everything in the story, so no plot holes, no missing stuff. If something happened multiple NPCs know about it and this adds to the feeling and atmosphere of the game.

Combat is good, flexible and complex, challenging, but not too hard. Even on harder settings the game is fun and enjoyable.

This game is far the best game in the franchise, but I picked it up after playing with the prequels, and I can say for sure it has a place in the Witcher universe. If you love this game I recommend picking up the first ones too.

A note about the ""DLC""s, if you can call them like that. They feel like a separate game, just like in the old days a good expansion was like another game but in the same game (even the devs call them expansion packs not DLCs). I recommend buying the GOTY edition because the Hearts of Stone and Blood and Wine will give you a whole new game with new experiences, new story and a good f**ng game. Honestly.

First the best parts: Great graphics, amazing combat, like [b]really amazing combat, the best in any ARPG[/b]. A pretty original story. Immersive environment.

This game is great, but it has one annoyance which is enemy placement in a certain few levels. The game is HARD. And I think in an attempt to ramp up difficulty in later stages, the game goes from being genuinely hard, where your skill determines if you win/lose, the game makes the decision to become cheap. It goes down the dark souls/demon souls path of basically laying out traps for your, like no way you can get through no matter how well you can parry/fight when so many ambushes await you. I can understand they want to make the game harder, but I don't think that's a good way to do it. I found it frustrating. It slowed down the action cause I'd have to figure out a way to not get ambushed or something else.

However, most of the game is great. There are some enemies which will force you to really master your combat to proceed. Combat is the best part of this game. Especially the boss battles. It's intense and thrilling, you feel great when you parry and counter, its so tight and rewarding.

I really wish this game was just boss battles cause those are the best. Just 1 on 1 combat that's really intense. Like Shadow of the Colossus style. That would cut out all the stuff in the middle which is not bad, but pales in comparison to the intensity and fun of the boss battles.

If any of these apply, you'll enjoy Factorio... If they only kind of applied, you'll also love Factorio.

Factorio is an incredibly well done, niche game that is quite possibly one of the most well done titles I've come across for a multitude of reasons.

On the surface, Factorio is a game about automation, logistics, and optimization.  It doesn't sound like it should be fun at all.  But when you get into the game itself, it ends up being more like a puzzle game, where you're trying to determine the best ways of maximizing yields from your machines.

It's easy to get complacient your first time playing the game through... Sure... One science facility is sufficient to unlock everything... you don't NEED more... but by the end, you'll be in a position where, why not build another couple hundred... a couple thousand.  Why?  Why not?  Each play through, you're astronomically faster at knowing the ideal logistics, you have the foresight for knowing problems that you've run into in the past to plan for the future, and you're more familiar with the game interface/hotkeys/etc to be able to execute your actions in a more timely fashion.

This game is also amazingly optimized as well on the actual programming side.  Multiplayer servers (still in beta), have been recorded, and videos are available to display the server supporting over 150 concurrent users with no lag.  Furthermore, the developers are incredibly engaged, and constantly trying to further develop the game.

It's weird to think of a game built around logistics, automation, factories, etc, would be so entertaining, and maybe that speaks more to me as a person than the game itself, but I recommend watching a video or two, and if it looks even marginally interesting, grabbing the game and giving it a shot.",1479601220,1480357244,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,True,76561197972338000,172,14,74789,876,7364,1610433475

The game is riddled with countless bugs, to the point it significantly affects your playstyle. The visuals leave much to be desired: every character, despite their apparent age looks like some tired drug addict, legendary blades look like pieces of cheap plastic. As for performance... it's horrible to put it mildly. The modding community has their hands tied with that limited toolset (FCS + in-game editor) they were provided with. With pretty much everything hardcoded, there isn't much they can do.

The great german empire settles berlin in 4000 BC. They soon build stonehenge and found protestantism. They settle down some cities in modern day denmark,poland, and latvia. Then russia founds East Orthodox in moscow. The russians convert the city of hamburg, and take the porelian tower. This starts the War of German Agression, which takes the cities of Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Yaroslarv'l. Then Franco-German War is started over a territorial dispute over the city of Orleans. After the cities of Troyes, and Orleans are taken, the French surrender. The Germans choose Order as their ideology, and After england denounced Bismark the Great and Powerful, The Germans amass a force of infantry, and rocket artilery, the British Surrender in 1860. The Second War of British Agression happens, and the British get wiped out in 1945. Then the War of Spanish-German Agression wipes out all spanish traces in Europe, but results in an embargo against Germany. The Germans fall into a depression, and military size decreases.

 -Districts take a mighty long time to build and once you build them they are clompletely useless( unless your embassies in city states boost the district) till you take another long time to create a building for that district
     
 -Spains Character, like the actual model himself has some minor graphical flaws like an arm and his hand

-Some Ai are just plain ridiculious, for example, i'm later in the game and a while back the Arabs had built a city right underneath my capital. I upgrade one spearman to a pikeman and they freak over the fact that im too powerful and have cities too close to them. Confusing to me.

-More about the Ai, they all love to hate you, all of them. I understand if they dont like you because of different government styles but is that really enough to denounce you over? Or even go to war? Im not sure, maybe it is.

-Also in the tech tree, it is very easy to skip ahead. It's obvious to me while researching things in the tech tree but mainly obvious with the Ai. I'm in the Medieval Era, the Aztecs some how reach the Industrial. Either I suck at the game and the Aztecs are legends or they just skipped ahead greatly. Plus I checked the worldrankings and for science victory i was number 1. Don't quite get that seeing how the Aztecs were in the Industrial Era.

-Another thing about the tech tree are the littler boosters, same goes for the Civil tree. The boosters were a pretty cool idea but kinda force you to play  the game in ways you may not want to. Such as building a military when none is needed and other things like that.. Plus it makes it way easier for some countries to get way ahead in technologies. One last thing about the boosters, they kinda ruin the creativity, i think i kinda said this already but it basically forces you to do things you dont want and thats not really fun.


Now im not sure how useful this review will be, if anything will change, if this'll get seen, but It is out there now to the public so I can feel like i've contributed to the game a little bit now. Of course none of these problems are going to prevent me from playing the game, but i would love it if some of them got changed or modified some way.

Stardew Valley encapsulates everything right with Harvest Moon and takes it up a notch. While the fundamentals are really similar to Harvest Moon/Animal Crossing, there are quite a few overhauls as well as subtle nuances that make Stardew Valley feel more complete in a sense. 

There's a ridiculous amount of depth even in the seemingly basic framework of what the game is focused on.  The game's visuals, whilst catering to the retro style of its predecessors, will still drop your jaw. Just as you're taking time to appreciate that, the game's soundtrack comes and blows you away while still staying very cohesive with how the game's art style feels. 

Mechanically, the game is quite intuitive to play and functions quite well. You're plopped into the setting and expected to find your own way. There's enough instruction to help you get started immediately, but the game is designed so that you're supposed to learn the in and outs as you go through experience. A refreshing taste compared to the overencompassing handholding that comes with many games as of late. 

The one gripe I have is regarding how the combat is fleshed out since you can only look in the 4 cardinal directions and it's sometimes difficult to land hits on mobs coming at you from an angle.

All in all, Stardew Valley feels like a very refined, appealing, and morbidly addicting game (I've literally eaten,slept,and Stardew-Valley-ed the last 2 days) that lives up to the hype and surmounts any negative assertions that it's just a boring rework or farmville on Steam.

It has not aged well. The textures and level design are very primitive and bare, and its platforming sections have fallen out of favor. The zombies are now just crowbar targets to me, and I've become apathetic towards the scientists and their cheesy deaths.

You can race, fistfight, play gwent, which that's a very easy card game, you can explore, and if you have hard time exploring you can buy maps or look at notice boards and they will pretty much just tell you where to go.  I think if you want to maximise you're fun, you should play the side quests first, then do the main quests.  One of the most funnest part of the game, is doing monster contracts. You negotiate your pay, gather evidence, track the monster, have an epic fight. Don't bad sad if you have hard time defeating some monsters. I'v been only playing on the hardest difficulty which is the ""Death March"" , and i think only at the start things are hard, but after lvl 15, things are generaly easy, but mabey that is just me.

It is a fun game.  It's a solid mix of Dawn of War 1 (2004), Warcraft 3 (2002) Dawn of War 2 (2009), Starcraft 2 (2010). with the ""powercore"" of a certain Warcraft3 mod.

(BTW to all the negative reviews about stripped down features, Dawn of War1 and Dawn of War2 had less to start AND gain most of their modern functionality with expansions)  

Campaign was a well spent 15 hours on Hard.  It has some replayability if you use different Elites or Doctrines during a mission.  Elites gain a ton of Experience from Campaign mode and the player can earn a large amount of skulls, which you use to unlock more Elites for all 3 armies.

My fears that CK3 would feel empty compared to its full-DLC predecessor were - thankfully - unfounded.  As others have said, many DLC-features of CK2 have been incorporated into the CK3 base game, and you can already have a rich gaming experience with the game as is.

That said, the two DLC/Expansions I've been looking forward to the most were/are the ability to play as Republics, and the Ruler Designer.  The latter having just dropped - and for free, no less, which was a smart move by Paradox - I'm very satisfied by how it improves upon the CK2 Ruler Designer in a number of ways.  My minor-ish quibble with the Ruler Designer in it's current state is that you don't seem to be able to manually edit your Dynasty (or primary holding) coat of arms, and have to rely on random CoA generation to get what you want.  (Though, upside is apparently that's a feature that will eventually come, but wasn't ready yet.  Hopefully it will be added in-game as well, so you can edit your titles' CoAs as desired.)  That aside, I'm very satisfied with the quality and smoothness of the new Ruler Designer, and am eagerly awaiting the ability to manually make custom CoA's in the future.  *fingers crossed*

Anyways, if you were/are unsure whether CK3 is worth buying in its current state, only you can make that final call (especially if you have a niche playstyle or love a certain mod that isn't recreated in CK3 yet), but I think there's a lot to enjoy already, and will likely only get better and better with time.",1606418693,1606418693,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198006789400,555,2,1410,0,1402,1606419321

Anyway - I'm so glad I took the plunge, I've barely dipped my toe in it and already I'm captivated by it. It really encourages you to learn about the world (where to find certain plants to make into oils, what oils work best against which monsters etc). You rarely see a game that makes you learn the same stuff that the character actually learns.

It all adds up to a world that feels so incredibly alive - victory can be hard fought, but with every victory you really feel like you've done more than button mash/thrown yourself against a wall until you get lucky. 

A smart Witcher lives a long time, a smarter Witcher when to run away ;)

An amazing game - pick it up if you like rpgs/engrosing narrative/swordplay/fantasy/sassy main characters

That said, I like the haptic feedback when the blades touch, and letting my blades slide along the big dodge blocks is fun. 
Hitting a long quick string of slashes without missing feels amazing.
I definitely recomend the game if you like rhythm games at all. It was very much worth the money, and I'm sure most of my critisisms will be addressed as the game continues to develop.

I've had this game since MAY 2014 - I have enjoyed it everytime I play it. If your into sandbox/openworld/RPG this game should be in your library or on your wish list. Tons of hours worth of gameplay for a game in Alpha.

THE GAME ITSELF: I prefer to start off on hardest mode - with nothing. Start off scrounging for goods off dead bandits after leading them towards guards to kill them fo me. Slowly gathering resources, buildings, hiring teammates, occasionally getting my a$* kicked by dogs or other enemies (quicksave is very useful here) - but the build up and effort delivers reward. 
HOWEVER - the game seriously is in need of some kind of storyline. I like to play towards an end goal, and at presen I am somewhat lacking this.

Development of the game e.g. new enemies, AI, buildings are steadily released along with bug fixes so developers are always active. If you need proof of the work being done just check out recent updates part of page.

Overall its a very good game to play through its development. Definitely worth the money in my opinion.

4834907,787860,Farming Simulator 19,46812402,english,"Ok, so this is my first ever review.

First off, let me say that I am a huge fan of FS series to date.  Particularly FS 17.

But on reflection I now realise that FS17 was great because it created a platform for modders to really up their game.
Now that I'm playing FS19 without mods, I've come to realise that the game is only good with mods. For me anyway.
For me, I like the dynamic of using Courseplay to effectively manage the farm as oppposed to just drive tractors etc.

Why doesnt Giants take ANY advice from its fans? We have been saying for years to add some kind of courseplay replica
to really enhance gameplay. We have also been asking for better ground working physics, more realism. One of the only games I have seen do this is Agriculture Simulator...yes it was an absolute shambolic mess from the get go, but they had the two things FS is missing. A management function AND better ground dynamics.


So heres a few pros and cons:

Pros
-The machinery looks really good. Particularly on High settings.
-There is a real ""weight"" to driving the bigger machines. This is helped by the new steering system too.
-Finally added John Deere. 
-Really interesting ""contracting"" model.

Cons
-The gameplay reminds me of the original FS. The monotony of drawing my own grain etc is creeping in.
-The maps are dogshit. Unimaginative. Badly planned. Again, reminds me of a bygone era of FS.
-There is NO useful infrastructure that you can buy. Couple of sheds and a vehicle workshop.
-4/10 times, my games crashes
-Ground dynamics are literally the exact same as FS17.
-Fuck all new machinery.
-WAAAYYY TOOOO DAAYYUMM EXPENSIVE YOOO

My verdict:

This game had real potential. The build up to release alone had me really pumped to get it. But its just a re-skinned version of FS17. I for one, will be going back to FS 17 until the very talented modders out there make this game great.",1543083469,1543083469,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198066657700,142,1,7742,0,603,1586294599

3064276,577800,NBA 2K18,43271468,english,"Well... I picked this game up for about 8 bucks. I still feel slightly ripped off for a couple reasons. A VAST majority of the issues are more or less quality of life problems honestly. I still feel the game is worth it on SALE but just want everyone to be aware of the issues.

I'll get the good stuff out of the way first.

Pros
+Game looks gorgeous
+Music is on point
+Sound design is amazing
+Immersion is real
+Story mode has a lot of humorous cutscenes, even though you want to skip them...
+A LOT of options for raising/lowering difficulty and options for game modes

Cons (Basically a list of four gripes that are common in either 2k games or just common amongst everyone who owns it)

First thing is that you can't skip any cut scene which makes the single player career mode a slog. Even just creating a new character with a new build is excruitiatingly painful because you have to watch roughly 20 minutes of cutscenese and are forced to skip out of at least 5 or 6 matches before you're actually playing in the NBA and even then your guy only gets roughly 2 minutes of playtime for like 4 or 5 games after. This mimics what might actually happen in real life with an undrafted rookie but seriously this is a video game. We can do without.

Second issue is the player progression. I've put in about 14 hours into the game in which at least 1/3 of that was cutscenes either watching people interact or watching my character do painfully slow transitions between locker room and court and halftime and time outs etc. So my ACTUAL playtime is probably more like 8 hours. You start out at level 60 and your guy is dog-shit. You won't make any impact on the game whatsoever be it park play or single player until you start jacking that up. Plus you don't have access to any cosmetics or augmentations at all until at least 65 and the ones that make the most impact are locked until post 70+. In order to unlock that level in a meaningful amount of time you need to grind out the in game currency (VC) or pay money for it. Granted, if you bought this on sale then buying a pack of VC for 10 bucks to get you to like 70 or 75 isn't too painful but it's those people who bought this for full price that I feel for. That's just shady and greedy behavior from a triple A title. However without the VC you will be suffering even on rookie difficulty for a while as you struggle to make 3's, dribble past a blocker, run around the court and even just passing the ball around is slow and difficult.

Third issue is the crashing. This happens at least once every time I load the game. I'm not sure what causes it but sometimes during a cutscene the game could just kick right out to desktop and die. It's not gamebreaking for me and I can deal with it but for other folks in the review section its worse. I'm not sure if it's related to a driver or gpu type or a OS issue but just make sure you read a little before you make the purchase.

Fourth issue is the fact that eventually, at some point in time, this game will lock you out of a lot of the features. This happens in every 2k game. Eventually the servers will be shut off and your stuff will be locked out and the only function you'll have is quick play. If you pay full price for this game this late in its life (currently 7/3/2018)  with 2k19 right around the corner you might have a year of time to get some of your single player stuff or custom stuff done before the servers go down for good on it. So ONLY get this on sale right now.

I'd say Kenshi is a one of a kind, a bit of a niche game.. there are very few you can compare it to.

The learning curve is steep, but the mountain top is not too high!
Because it is a open world sandbox game you can play Kenshi in so many different ways
Everything from being just a handful of very highly trained ninjas to a big warband of mercenaries, or perhaps you want to be a merchant, set up shop inside a city ? or build your very own city and bring trade to you!

I have 140 hours on record all played with the same savegame and i consider myself having reached 'end game' if that term even applies to a game such as this :P and what I will say is there are end game features missing, such as proper diplomacy, ways of making your own actual faction/kingdom, waging war + the fact that only half the map is playable. So I feel like I am out of things to do on my current savegame because I am strong enough to assult cities and wiping them out, but it doesnt lead to alot currently..
but trust me when I say the journey there was SO enjoyable I can't even.. and the devs do work on it and update it frequently adding in all these things that are missing!

Actual review below :

Dead by Daylight or 'DbD' as it is often reffered to by the playerbase is equal parts excellent and total piece of shit at the same time.

Though after playing it for more than 150 hours i'm confident enough that it's 49% excellent and 51% shit so that's where  negative review comes from.

While it has just a superb idea for the game , developers are absolutely incompetent to take care of their own game. By solving one balance issue they make two more, by fixing one bug they make two new ones . In short they are ' fixing and balancing' this game to point of no return ( which in my opinion has already been reached ) .

Amazing ideas are well..amazing but they also need skilled team behind them to realise and maintain them. It's not the case with DbD and they just keep on pilling problems on top of one another .

Only way i see for this game to be any good is to rethink this game alltogether ( mechanics wise  ) and begin new with second installment because at the current state this game is hopeless to get any better.",1518867967,1606807129,False,6,0,0.518443822860718,0,False,False,False,76561198076311700,457,36,31791,0,31791,1577113209

Biggest cons: I experienced a game breaking glitch that wouldn't allow me to move at a certain part of the game. I evetually found a way to bypass this by downloading someone else's save file from a forum and using it to play from the start of that particular level. Also, mouse controls aren't as responsive as they could be, sometimes you feel like your gliding on ice; but you do have the option of using the keyboard arrows in place of the mouse.

Campaign- never done it yet lol

Multiplayer- suprisingly like mw2 more than bo3 if you ask me

Zombies- Zombies

MWR- needs patch to fix the stuttering issues then will be GREAT AGAIN 

NEW REVIEW
 MWR is stupid af and cod itself is as well... first the thing a lot of people care about MWR is broken on pc... it runs so terribly i stopped playing it after a week while on infinite warfare i get a steady 80 fps... the loading time in MWR can take up to 3 minutes somtimes if you dont have a solid state drive which is just stupid... the campaign i still have not completed the campaign on infite warfare because the sound cuts out constently and the game also stutters way more in the campaign making me want to pull my hair out... the next cod is going to suck too, even though its going to be boots on the ground heres the issue... it's not made by Treyarch... and every COD is going to have mp is going to be broken forever now because of the pay to win bullshit cases that have weapons in them.... EVEN  THE GAME THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A CLASSIC COD WTF... yes MWR the ""classic COD shooter"" has pay to win cases with weapons that werent in the original game... now zombies... zombies is alright but one problem... its not made by treyarch....

The pacing is perfect. Never do you truely feel rushed, or that you've had to grind very hard. Sure its a Survival Crafting game, but resources are easily found and well spent, and progression is simple... travel farther, travel deeper. You'll be at the edge of your seat exploring the deep, dark, and frightening depths, while trying not to get eaten by one of the leviathans that dwell in the dark. Uncover the mystery of planet 4546B, and finish the job your precursors started.

The game starts off with the Aurora, a megacorp builder ship flying near orbit of plant 4546B, a mysterious and nearly oceananic world. The spacecraft has been struck by something and is crashing down to the surface. You scramble to get to your lifepod and safely make it down to the surface. From here you need to utilize the planets natural resources to survive, and try to establish contact for other survivors and rescue.
As you explore further, you discover you've become infected with a bacteria that appears to be in every lifeform on the planet. Quickly you begin to discover that curing yourself of this bateria, and escaping the planets surface are the same objective.

While some can be put off by the game's low-res graphics or the somewhat confusing interface and controls, this game will present you with a dynamic and utterly surprising story-telling.

While recent updates have forced me to rebuild a couple of times, the gameplay is so addictive that I honestly don't care.

Some of the gamemodes include:
- Sandbox
- TTT (Trouble in Terrorist Town)
- SantosRP
- Star Wars RP
It is constant fun (not necessarily for the whole family) but nonetheless great. This game also kickstarted my career in video game development and 3D Modeling. Any developer would have loads of fun (especially if they know what they're doing). The community is usually split into these categories: 
- Roleplayers
- Mingy Roleplayers
- TTT players
- Star Wars nerds (nerds meant in a good way).
- and Hitler Hailing Memers.
This game is amazing, I rate 9.5/10.

5262958,1190460,DEATH STRANDING,73150552,english,"Overall Score: 8/10

tl;dr: An experience that you won't be able to forget easily. Although it has some of the best artistic decisions ever taken, and some brand new ideas, its gameplay always drag around and annoy the player. While THAT is the basic premise of the game, it heavily wounds the storytelling and makes the experience less enjoyable. If you manage to get used to its abysmal controls and gameplay mechanics, you will at least enjoy the story and the scenery.

Death Stranding is... something else. It is the ultimate love/hate experience for me. I can easily say that i disliked a big portion of this game: Gameplay. But no matter what annoying thing the game had thrown at me, i managed to beat it and i'm grateful that i did. I played on Normal and thank god for that. 

What i absolutely enjoyed, is the cinematography of this game. Even when you're not in a cutscene and just... simply walking on vast cliffs and listening to ""Don't Be So Serious by Low Roar"", game never fails to make you feel that you're in a movie. Camera angles, the overall atmosphere, feeling of solidarity and the little semi-online elements that sometimes make you feel like you're not actually alone and can feel safe here and there.

The another thing i very much liked was the semi-online system implemented into the game. Developers tried this system in a few other games as well but this is the first time i'm seeing this used in an actually good manner. Although it is a single player game, thanks to it's community shaped open world it almost feels like a multiplayer game. Player feels that s/he is a part of a big broad community. This is something very hard for a single player game to accomplish. Kudos to the Kojima Productions team especially on this.

Decima Engine is an absolute miracle. Whenever i've had a PS4 and i played Horizon: Zero Dawn (which will be out on PC soon, yay), i knew how unbelievably great this engine is. Guerilla Games did such a tremendously good job while creating this engine and it really shines on PC at 1440p, ultra details. Scenery feels almost photorealistic. Character models, mimics, animations, everything is visually flawless. And it never pushed my system around. Gave constant 60 frames per second on a system with GTX 1070, i5 6600, 16 gigs of ram and while its on an SSD.

So let's get down to the dirty business and talk about what i didn't like about this game and what made me give it an 8 instead of a perfect 10. Because this game could've had a perfect 10 easily. Gameplay is so, so bad. Like, abysmal bad. Terrible. I know that they tried to go with a more ""realistic"" approach while designing the gameplay elements but instead of feeling realistic, it felt annoying. Vehicle controls were so annoying, i had to walk for a good part of the game. I can't get myself to drive around easily without crashing on to a small rock every 10 seconds. And it is a small rock, really. A rock that you righftully expect your 4X4 land cruiser to absolutely go over. But it doesn't happen. It's like, the vehicles in this game have magnets attached to them. Magnets that pull your vehicle to rocks and all kinds of obstacles around. I never enjoyed travelling around in this game.

The first 10 or so hours were great. There were no artificial difficulty enhancers. Mules were as dumb as my character, BTs were easy to avoid and were very thrilling-fun at first. But after around 5 or 6 episodes it started getting annoying. Now i knew how to bypass BTs. I knew how to beat them. They were not thrilling anymore. They were just another CHORE i had to deal with. See, when a gameplay mechanic feels like a chore, that's in my opinion, a failure. They could've added some variety at least to the BT encounters just as they did to MULES. They get new weapons and new strategies as the game develops further. But BTs always stay the same. Except maybe towards the end chapters. 

Combat wasn't as good, gunplay wasn't as good, the GAME aspect of this experience just wasn't as good. It is not a walking simulator, no. Do not believe the angry mob that mockingly calls this game a WALKING SIMULATOR. It is not. Although it is terrible, it still has a good chunk of gameplay in it. You constantly micro manage your strategies, your workload, your deliveries, equipment, route, etc. Gameplay is there, really. It's just not as thrilling when you hit the 20 hours mark. It gets old and boring.

The times i most enjoyed this game were the cutscenes and straight-forward story bits. No packages to deliver, no chores to accomplish, no backtracking, just you and the story carrying along together. I wish there were more of these moments in the game. Because the amount of ""standard deliveries"" is huge and if you try to complete all of them like i did in the first few episodes, you will get a burnout and will rush to end the story. Even the mandatory orders felt like chores. I remember yelling at the game a few times just because it didn't let me progress through the story which i'm very curious about and made me do another mandatory chore. I get the idea behind it but... it is a game after all. It has to be fun.

BUT two issues made me request a refund:
* Playing as killer is way too easy, makes it extremely unforgiving to play as survivor and not very entertaining to play as killer.
* Can't play with friends against/with others online. There's an apparent risk of exploitation in allowing that form of matchmaking the way the character progression is designed right now, but come on devs - there's plenty of ways to design around this issue! For instance:

1. Encourage people to play with strangers by increasing a score multiplier for every stranger in the lobby.
2. Make a separate score for character progression in private matches.
3. Trust your players to play the game the way it's meant to be played, and let sploiters sploit if they must.

If you're familiar with the Civilization series, then you're already well aware that they've traditionally been turn-based strategy games that let you play as the political leader of one of the world's nations (such as Gandhi of India or Julius Caesar of Rome) in a fictitious bid to take over the globe, starting from the Stone Age and continuing right on through to the Space Age by having a lone settler unit build your first city on the way to establishing whatever advanced society you choose to design over the course of dozens of turns. The series gives you plenty of ways to do this, such as conquering your neighbors, researching advanced technology, or, in Civilization III (and IV), creating the most cultured society on the planet. It's this great variety that helps give Civ IV the same alarmingly addictive quality its predecessors carried. And thanks to its many improvements, major and minor, and its greater emphasis on strategy over bean-counting, Civ IV isn't just as good as Civ has ever been...it's better.The Civ series' gameplay has several components, and almost every single one of them is improved in Civ IV. For instance, the series' combat system, which pits different military units against one another based on relative unit strength and technology, has been changed to a ""strength"" system that seems more intuitive. Units that are greatly advanced will have a clear advantage over more-primitive ones (to avoid the commonly cited, though rare, case of a tribal spearman defeating a tank in previous games), and military units in general have many different upgrades they can earn as they receive experience points and gain power levels. In addition, artillery has been tweaked to be much more useful. It can bombard targets, such as enemy cities, to lower defenses and to deal collateral damage to large ""stacks"" of armies. These improvements don't make battles all that much more complicated , but they do add more depth to combat, since both attackers and defenders have more factors to consider.",1393517640,1393517640,True,1,0,0.500264406204224,0,True,False,False,76561198065595100,415,4,17033,0,7263,1533497527

5168255,779340,Total War: THREE KINGDOMS,74944062,english,"The concept is cool, but pacing is extremely slow. Learning the in-battle commands is tedious. For example, just getting your guys to move from point A to point B in the same formation is like 3 different shortcuts (Ctrl+G, Select Group, Left-Alt+Right Click? I'm pretty sure?). Then by the time my dudes show up to the fight, half of them are dead, the others are out of formation that I spent all the time in the world setting up... And this isn't even considering the match-up between units, which gets thrown out of balance anyway due to the Romance playstyle. It's taken me 55 hours and several YouTube videos to try to learn this game. It's my opinion, but any game that literally has multiple several-minute-long videos in the pause menu yet still can't convey the mechanics of the game correctly puts a sour taste in my mouth.

I did like that they give the player the option to play differently. There is a Romance version and Records version. Romance adds an extra layer of variability, and the game centers more around the generals and their unique traits. Records keeps it a little more tactical/logical, and keeps the fights more predictable. I opted for the Records version, as I am interested in learning the basics without the extra variables, but I can see some veterans of the series enjoying the extra unpredictability in the Romance version.

I want to like this game. but to me, it's like reading an excel sheet that looks nicer. And this is coming from a guy that loves XCOM, Gears Tactics, Age of Empires, and Battletech. I've also played every numbered Dynasty Warriors, including the Empires series. I'll continue to play 3K because I spent 60 bucks, and at this point I feel like it's a sunk cost, but given the choice, I'd take a full refund.

If you are a person who relishes the wait and are willing to sink time into learning the mechanics, I think this game could really reward you. For me, the Action-to-Click Ratio is a little too low.

I dont particularly like to mention others products in a review, it's just bad etiquette. But I feel I have to do this in order for you to understand this review in the right perspective, and dear ChuckleFish and ConcernedApe I'm sorry.

I came to Stardew Valley from games like Terraria, RimWorld and Factorio and outside of steam I have played Cataclysm DDA alot. These are great games who all fits my preference very well. And I tend raise or max the difficulty settings too, when I can.

So as you might already suspect I am the kind of gamer who likes tinkering. And obscure mechanics. And tough gameplay from day one. I WANT a steep learning curve. I WANT to die. I WANT to min/max my characters layers of clothing and arsenal of guns/swords/tentacles/whatever.

But I also want a cookie now and then! Like when I figure out the right meta strategy for a general problem, or find out that the barrel of pure alcohol made with the cooking skill can be attached to the gardenblower. And I use it to MASSIVELY hand out some serious whoopass to those zombies with that stupid grin on their faces, who just before killed me for the oompteenth time. BURN suckers! Feel the pain of a thousand suns! PAYBACK!

I guess you might see where this is going? You're right. Stardew Valley is pretty nice. And it's pretty nice to me aswell. And I just can't take it!!!

I wish eternal darkness would descend on the valley. I wish evil aliens would flood from the mines and I wish the neighboring towns would just INVADE the valley to pillage my farm and do unmentionable things to my dog. And I would have my revenge... I would turn all those thousands of parsnips in my fields into a GREAT weapon of destruction.

But alas. The valley keeps being nice to me. I guess this is great for my wife... She likes it. But I CAN'T have it! So ChuckleFish and CorcernedApe, thanks for having me and thanks for being nice.

I don't recommend the game if you like HARD... If you like to get PAYBACK! I do however recommend it if you like nice, and this is what Stardew Valley tried to be. So I guess it's ultimately going to be a thumbs up from here.

Oh. And goodbye. I will not be back.

Honestly I suck at it right now, transition to keyboard is tough for me, but the game play, the massive increase in graphical fluidity is awesom, but what is best about the game is the game modes and the spawn system, your team has an incentive to take objectives and PTTFO in a way that even hardened console gamers on BF4 would avoid, it ups the realism, as does the TTK, when I actually manage to get the drop on some one its usually over in one or two hits, despite the requirement to play a slower and more concidered game in terms of pushing up to objectives and clearing buildings, the game still feels fast.....or maybe I'm just getting old?!....

1. The game has the most bizarre and unreasonable hit detection. ""Whats that your sword connected but you got hit as it did, sorry you stopped your swing."" ""Whats that the enemy missed his thrust with a spear but he was facing you as he pulled back from finishing the thrust, well that hit you and did 100% of your health either though you are in heavy armor""
2. The game suffers the biggest bs exploit with horizontal strikes that everyone called out should be removed from the game that literally inspired this game. The classic whip your mouse as you swing to make it last longer than the action should be based on how its programmed
3. Swing speed is inconsistant. You'll have fights where two people use the same weapon and armor and somehow one can combo attacks off faster than the other with out anything like chambering happen
4. Finally Friendly fire should not exist in this game. You penalize people on accidents( 9/10 its cause a teammate runs in front of you as you are already swinging at the enemy) so you loose out score which matters to the pay out you get at the end of the match on top of that it makes so if you have a group happen someone cant swing in the direction needed to make a hit cause on the swing back the broken hit detection will have it register as a full on blow on a teammate. This issue is even worse for archers and those who use fire bombs. On top of that it forces everyone to waste loadout points just to lower the damage the receive and dish out to teammates
I loved this game starting out but it quickly faded as soon as these issues flooded everything good about it.

I do have a few problems, while I love the entire game I think it really picks up on the Super gore nest level so you have to play for at least like 2 or 3 hours(depending how good you are at the game), the soundtrack isnt that good it still like in 2016 just sounds mostly the same to me, they shouldve used buff totems and purple goo more, removed swimming and fix the hit detection on the blood punch.

The story, especially compared to its predecessors, is really bad. Plenty of retcons, inconsistencies and unlikable characters. The villains lack depth and charisma, making it difficult to enjoy their presence in the story as ""the bad guys"". In other words, the Calypso Twins are no Handsome Jack. The pacing of the story also feels inconsistent. At one point you're on a planet for a grand total of 45 minutes, then you're on another planet for 6 hours. I could go on about other negatives to the story, but that would include spoilers. There's plenty of videos out there critiquing the story already. Suffice it to say, I don't play Borderlands for the story alone, which would limit the enjoyment the game does offer.

Which leads me to the positives! The gameplay is fantastic, probably the best in the series. Every gun feels unique, despite having no red flavor text. Makes you feel as if there's a seemingly endless choice of weapons. There's also a lot of quality of life additions we haven't seen before, such as having access to the Fast Travel network anywhere you're standing, and being able to fill your ammo supply with a press of a button near a vending machine.

Overall, I would wait for a sale and not spend $60 on the game.

for instance creating duplicate bindings can be a little wierd since you have to press both buttons you want to have the single command bound to at the same time which can be kind of tricky if you want to bind inventory right/left for instance to both the bumpers and triggers. also i don't think they even tell you that you could make duplicate bindings, i found out how to do this by just screwing around for a bit in the menus.

initially i thought the game was somewhat challenging but then i quickly found out that the game lets you do the common RPG overleveling tactic where you just play the first few levels a bunch of times to get good gear before the game initially intended on it. luckilly this doesn't apply to everything but there's quite a bit that it does apply to.

also battletoads? really? you could have picked Commander Keen as a PC exclusive reference to a retro platforming game but you pick battletoads for the PC side of the exclusive easter egg stuff based on the platform the game is on in the style of super meat boy... ok then.

I've played all DoW games including every expansion and it was something about that MOBA feel that I couldn't get into.  The game had a feeling where every regular unit you create was fodder, and could easily be rekt by even low level hero unit's, regardless of how many you have on the map.

However, after playing the full game I'm getting a better understanding of what they were going for.  There are many different ""hero units"" to choose from, more than what was in the beta. There are elite units that call in a strong squad like warp spiders or striking scorpians (I play eldar) for an affordable amount of hero points and they have strong abilities that can turn the tide of battle early, or you can save hero points and call up one of the huge walker unit, but by the time you get the hero points for that it might be too late.  

The worst aspect of the multiplayer for me is the cover system, there are random points that just don't make sense strategically, and its easy to wipe out a unit in cover, gone are the days where there is light and heavy cover all over the map.

Last thing, I was also disappointed with a lot of the small things that felt like they were missing from the last game, but it seems like they decided have a lot of skills/perks have to be selected before going into battle.  For example, eldar didn't have a unit to make energy shields, but later saw it could be done a one of the 3 selectable perks before the multiplayer game starts.

It's a pretty game game, the single player is what you'd expect from DoW.

I managed to fix the problem by going into the Steam files and reinstalling the anti-cheat software manually after searching for solutions online and getting assistance from Urbisoft.

I have now played another couple of games. While I agree with some reviews that state that the game has become harder, I never managed to do much above veteran level anyway so not much change there for me. It is still as fun as I remember.

People complain that it's just ark with a pirate skin but let's be real here folks, most of these so called ""AAA titles"" are just reskinned versions of the previouis title and I don't see the hate for those games....

I bought the game 2 weeks after release so my experiences may not reflect those who played on day 1. 

In my 40+ hours I have not had a single crash or come across any major bugs that have stopped my progress or ruined my experience. The rubber banding was pretty bad the first couple of days I played but after yesterdays update I had an entire evening where the performance was great. No rubber banding and a constant 60 FPS.

The most annoying thing I had an issue with besides the rubber banding was trying to climb ship ladders which can be a bit annoying. I have played a lot of EA games and I'd put this up there as one of the best EA titles I have played, many EA games release with almost no content and major bugs but this game has a lot of content and little bugs (from my experience)

If you like survival/crafting games but want more of an mmo feel then this is a great title and you'll enojoy the game. If you prefer games like rust then you may not enjoy this game.

It's very slow paced and encourages grouping up in to larger groups than your average survival pvp game. Diplomacy is as much of a part of the game as piracy is.

This game does not deserve the hate it's been getting and I'd recommend this to any survival/crafting/building fan that wants a pirate themed mmo",1546720433,1546720433,True,3,0,0.477579683065414,0,True,False,True,76561198010044800,109,12,3655,0,3171,1546841728

For all its flaws ( and there a few) I would give this game a thumbs up and recommend it. Overall the game isnt so bad, the graphics are stunning, the units for all factions are interesting and fun to use which you get to play with across a relatively alright campaign. The multiplayer is challenging and now has an anhilation mode which is very fun to play. 

When it comes to the flaws there are a few that i couldnt help but pick up on. The first one which bugged me was Gabreil Angelos, for whatever reason they have decided to change the voice actor and I miss his booming, authotarian space marine chapter master, hammer swining motherfucker I have come to love from the first and second dawn of war games. The game has overalled alot of mechanics and now heavily leans on how well you can micro manage the abilities of each unit to really get the full use of them. it reminds me much of DOTA except you can have dozens of units and one big skirmish each with their own ability that you need to constantly focus on, especially in the PVP. The cover system as you know it is gone, replaced by these rather strange shield domes which become uselss if your attacked by a melle unit. 

The campaign spans across 17 levels where you flip between the three factions which i disliked. im a big space marine fan boy and would have preferred to have a seperate campaign for all factions but the campaign itself was a fun experience if not very predictable. I also felt that there are not equal amount of missions for each faction and that they are all not the same length, so you could play a big mission with the Eldar that can take around 45 mins and then a quick space marine mission that lasts 20 then your straight back into the eldar again. 

There may seem like a few bad points but the biggest thumbs up for me and this game is that its just plain FUN. I play video games because there challenging and fun and DOW 3 does that pretty well. The Ork scrap mechanic to upgrade units and build vehicles is pretty sweet and watching a whole army of eldar getting chewed up by twin Imperial Knight gattling guns was just seriously fucking cool. 

Yes the game has dumbed down, yes it isnt as big as Dark Crusade or Soulstorm in terms of campaing and invading provinces and planets, yes they removed some good features from previous titles and your correct, it isnt the best DOW title. But its bloody fun to play.",1504219856,1504219856,True,4,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198097977200,193,3,3509,0,2062,1598644149

These are just some of the things that makes this game great. The graphics are simple but are also very detailed (e.g. the metal in rooms, hallways etc. is mainly just white, but it is high quality and reflective which is cool).

One thing that annoyes me the most about modern games, yes I'm looking at you Metro, is the fact that you are basically only watching cutscene after cutscene and you're barely even allowed to do anything yourself. 
Everything that looks remotely like it could be fun happens in cutscenes.

In Half life everything story releated happens while you're playing, without ever being interrupted. Characters talk to you when you run past and if you don't wanna listen to what they have to say you can just run by without caring, it's up to you.

Also the game doesn't bother explaining everything to the point that even a 3 year old would understand it, the leveldesign is so well thought out that you'll never even end up asking yourself what to do. If you can't take the most obvious route (because of a locked door for example), all you have to do is look around and you'll find other paths to take, or at least clues of what you are looking for. That is much better than markers all over the map or an annoying AI running with you telling you the same hint over and over again.

One thing that bothered me a little bit would be how ridiculously inaccurate certain guns are, but overall the gunplay and movement feels very solid and obviously familiar for cs players.

It's a tiny download, you can grab it for under $2 during steam sales, it runs on every toaster and is an absolute pillar in the world of gaming, why are you even reading reviews?

First patch brought in Denuvo Anti-Cheat, which is a extremely bad thing to have on your PC.  Anti-Cheat installs a kernel on the lost level of your PC.  Meaning it has the ability if abused to collect and do anything on your PC.  If a vulnerability is ever found, which is highly likely given Denuvos track record.  This would leave your PC open for very nasty attacks. 

Besides the HUGE secure issues with this update.  Denuvo also is effecting game performance, corrupting saves and it out right Killed Linux support.  

So with a heavy heart I can't give support to DOOM Eternal on PC.  The update has not effected other platforms yet.  An as long as it doesn't I can  recommend game only on those platforms.











Completed Campaign on Ultra-Violence:

Pros:
Runs slick and smooth.  
Combat is intense and brutal, but rewarding
Sounds are amazing
Monster designs and levels all look beautiful 
Just so much details and small things, can't list them all
Picture of Slayer holding is bunny.
The sound track...

Cons:
Some of the water puzzles slow down the combat
Note really a con, more of  pro, but a con for me:  Ambient sounds made me have to take a break every hour or so on some levels.  Some of them just were really freaky and struck a creepy cord I didn't know I had.

Though it is a clunky game that needs some polish and doesn't look great to 2021 standards, it's nonetheless a very fun experience if you're the type of gamer that likes games like dwarf fortress, rimworld and fallout 4. 

I love how you can build a settlement almost anywhere (except around towns). The game has a really clever system for entity relationships - not only NPCs can have slaves, but you can also have slaves, and NPCs can enslave you, even. 

The health system is very similar to rimworld, albeit a bit less complex. You can get wounded limbs that will be less effective and even lose limbs altogether.

Difficulty wise I think the game is still insanely hard, it can get easy but you need tons of grinding to get there. I know it's part of the vision of a harsh open world, but I still wish I could defeat some low level enemies when I start playing without having to grind a bunch of attributes first.

Enter the Gungeon is an excellent experience for those who like both Issac and Throne, but honestly? I'd say it leans towards Issac in terms of how much each player would enjoy the game.

From what I've seen, some Throne players think the game is still a little too slow for their tastes. I can understand that. It IS a lot slower than NT from what I've seen, but I still like it.

While the BoI + NT = EtG still stands, I think the Gungeon can bring it's own audiance as well.

Also if theres something that makes Gungeon standout in it's simularites between NT and BoI, is the Bullet Hell. FUCK is this game so Bullet Hell. NT can get that way too, but it's eliviated slightly by Melee weapons. This game might give you Blanks sure, but those are limited.

The expansions are also not your typical ""AAA"" cash grab, they are full experiences of their own. 

Fully voiced, beautifully crafted, and choices that will alter the outcome of the story beyond what most of you will be used to. Unlike many games, this one fully deserves the pile of awards it was given. 

The game is definitely for an older audience. Just watch the trailers.

But that doesn't justify shambling together a barely functioning game to leech off of something so near and dear to every gamer's heart. Being Half-Life 2, of course.

Like, literally - he'd describe some situations his colony got in and how the settlers dealt with it and I thought, ""Well, that's nice but this is some weird sixteen bit head floating on a tee shirt shooting at another head on a tee shirt I guess you just dropped some acid and decided to invent some weird backstory between these two people about how they made an ongoing friendship and eventually one was captured and joined the colony where they were the best of friends until a love triangle split them up and they ended up hospitalizing each other in a social fight and one died and the other lived on but eventually died of depression.""

Turns out no, that was not acid induced. That's just how things come together in this game. A lot. 

And that's not even mentioning the complexity of how the actual settlement mechanics work. 

My sister bought me this game and now I'm all angry that I lost days of my life. But that's fine, this game has some incidental storytelling that outdoes releases from 2018 that intentionally attempt to try and get you emotionally involved, like Far Cry and other rpgs.

atari has not lied they have seemed to kept to rollercoaster franchise... only problem is for a game that has advanced so much and for a company that has kept us waiting for so long.... there is for me is no wow factor and no real bonus yes it a ""nice"" beta yes i love the patch on there and i like the having a building for staff... the laying out a rollercoaster is easy ""even tho i always been rubbish at coasters"" and it not utter bad game it just not worth the money it just rct3 with fancier graphics



as you will see if you read through my waffleing on this game is not bad bad but it is just not ""special"" maybe it will be in future but this game as yet has not yet grabbed me and planet coaster even tho is still only in alpha where this is beta and months after its first beta fail it still not grabbed me where as planet coaster has grabbed my imagination it just feels like a modern rollercoaster world

ok planet coaster and this game are like comparing battlefield series and black ops we all have our favorites and will never agree it another iphone vs android i played this a little while today even tho it is a fair game i personally feel that even though planet coaster is in alpha and you cannot build a roller coaster yet i will be heading that way atm as i love the building kiosks into building idea and it just for me feels better..... currently in my view at moment if your after a quick theme park game try alpha of parkitect which is a quick but easy game indie style theme park... if your after  a theme park game that easy nice looking and for a bit longer then this is your game.... but if your after using your creativity like theme park with sims then planet coaster is best even though it no where near beta yet... once again the building buildings is brilliant idea already starting to feel like a real theme park

i will check this game frequently but in truth needs more the champagne that he was drinkin on the stream maybe he celebrating how we brought the windows 95 of gaming

Dead by Daylight has lots of good stuff, and I'd definitely recommend it to my friends.  It's one of the most fun games I can enjoy with my friends. That thrill of being either the killer or a survivor is just the perfect kind of rush for games. When the fear goes away, there's still that comical goofy fun players can still have. I'd have to warn them that they need a good computer. It is literally impossible to play it on an average laptop; I speak from experience.

What are the downsides? The top flaw would have to be the matching system. It's such a pain when amateur killers are stuck getting seasoned pros or vice versa, but at the same time it makes the game that much more surprising and thrilling.
Like this flaw, I can view the brightside of all the other problems I find in this game, which are few.

5001401,397540,Borderlands 3,73337051,english,"While the main game hovers somewhere between ""yea, kinda fun"" and ""why can't I skip this?"" the endgame is utterly broken. You can't expect a borderlands game to be balanced. But the abomination that is Mayhem mode is deeply unfun until you reach maxed gear at which point you have no other goals to archive. I'm not saying this as some casual pleb who just wants to mindlessly indulge in pure power fantasy I'm saying this as a dedicated fan of the borderlands franchise who patiently waited for this game for over five years while farming my way through OP8 even on the fucking commando. The ""mayhem mode"" leaves you without instructions and 10 levels of pain each with its own unique modifiers most of which are either already hated mechanics copied from other games or skills you'd get while leveling up your ""common zelot"" unit in a strategy game, but you won't see most of these modifiers either as you will be skipping through the tiers as fast as you can because the higher your mayhem level the higher the mayhem level on your loot. Because we have learned absolutely nothing from the common reaction to bl2s op levels and wanted to ReWaRd DeDiCaTeD pLaYeRs with more digital shit they can grind for.
So, if you want a game with endgame content that'll ask you to increase your mastery to extreme extends go play the moba of your choice trust me even those feel better balanced.
If you're just here because you wanna shoot shit go ahead you might have some good fun.

For the people coming to bl3 expecting a borderlads 2 level story go play The Pre Sequel. Because: The story of the main game looks like they fired their writer halfway through and thought ""how hard can it be?"" then got them back after 3 years of development just, so they can glaze over the shit produced.
You might find enjoyment in the stories of the natives of Eden six and Promethia tho. Some of those use humor in a borderlandsesque way.
The DLCs might just be worth a play as well but I personally wouldn't like to pay for the platform just, so I can buy the actual thing extra.

And for the devs.
1. Head Writer is an important position. And writing in general is more important than you think.

Pros-
- 19 has slightly better graphics than 17
- 19 allows you to edit the terrain and reform your land without a mod
- 19 added horses, which is pretty cool
Cons-
- I only have 1 real con, 19 has a different platform making it more difficult for users to create and edit mods, because of this there are far less mods available (only so far hopefully), also because of this, some of the available mods have bugs or just flat out do not work. It's been 4 months so far and no seasons mod yet. All of the great mods from 17 like, seasons, real tire dirt, real ground response, courseplay, follow me, farming tablet, gearbox, more realistic gameplay, proseed, gps, and other great mods, are not available for the 19 version. If these mods start coming out I will upgrade my review to a positive review no doubt, but until then, I say 17 is the best sim so far. I'll still recommend this game though because, hey, farming simulator flat out rocks to begin with.",1552693979,1552693979,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198179823900,30,2,15154,0,4095,1573431147

Lore, world building, game balancing, it all feels Pathfinder and the experience is awesome, mainly now with turn based mode implemented. The game is not perfect though. The kingdom building system is completely flawed and account for pretty much no benefit throughout your adventures in the Stolen Lands.

I didnt hear a lot about Hollow Knight before i started playing so i wasn't expecting much but after playing the first few hours i already loved the game so much that i didnt play anything else for a week. I even spent ~10h on an optional, hidden jumping puzzle to complete everything the game had to offer back then.

I would consider Hollow Knight a must-play title for every Metroidvania fan.

-Artstyle 10/10: it looks beautiful

-World design 10/10: highly interconnected levels, every section has its own design and feels different, you dont have to follow a certain path

-Music 10/10: Great, atmospheric music

-gameplay 10/10: The movement feels great especially after obtaining Dash, Wings and Claw. 

-difficulty 10/10: Every fight and jumping puzzle feels fair and possible. The difficulty is comparable to Dark Souls and the most difficult things are optional.

-price/performance 10/10: This game is worth every cent.

-Lore/Story 10/10: It's no boring selfexplaining story. You have to discover it by yourself.

5297734,629760,MORDHAU,65965632,english,"I've played 300+ hours of this game since the DAY it was released. This game used to be very fun! Combat was fast, quick paced, skill oriented. It was awesome! Worked great in one on one fights and in team play. After the latest patch, Patch #17, they've ruined all of it. Movement speed has been reduced greatly. Everything feels like slowmo. Long weapons are no longer viable as they have reduced damage in certain areas and are MUCH slower, to the point that they aren't worth it at all. They removed the ""swing through teammates"" mechanic, (this mechanic was used so if you swing your weapon and hit a teammate, your sword will go through and hit the enemy you're trying to hit). This mechanic was abused somewhat but kept the combat fast paced and fluid. Now that's gone and if you use a big weapon, you're extremely likely to hit a teammate and instead of going through, now it bounces off. Combat with big weapons was nullified. Do you still want to have fun in this game? Well, you're going to have to play with a small, fast, low damage weapon. That's the only way. Otherwise it's just a game of waiting until you get killed during the super long swing. There used to be two great mechanics, accels and drags! You could look forward during a swing and make your weapon move quicker, or look back to drag out the swing and make it slower! That broke up the pace of combat and kept you on your toes! That was ruined with Patch #17. Accels and drags are completely broken now, you can't do it well like you could before. It's been reduced to a cheap gimmick. 

Okay so what a good part of this game? Team modes. They are incredibly fun and fluid, fighting multiple enemies with your teammates all fighting beside you. It's a dangerous game because not only do you have to worry about hitting enemies and not dying, you also have to be careful and strike properly and carefully so you don't take out a teammate!!!

Sounds great right? Well not anymore. Patch  #17 ruined that too. The game has been turned from team battles to 1v1s. That's what is being pushed hard right now. No one is asking for it, but by God they (devs) are doing it! Now the team battles have turned into duels and nothing more. It's almost impossible to fight in a team battle after this update because the patch has changed the mechanics to suit dueling and nothing else. Now the fun game modes like Invasion and Frontlines have turned into mini duel servers except now you duel with someone and get stabbed in the side by another guy because ""hey! you can't fight multiple people anymore!"" 

I would not recommend purchasing this game till all of this get's fixed if it ever will. If something isn't done about this terrible update, I'm done playing this game. 

The playerbase is dying off already. Why kill the game more? 

Devs, we ask you to fix bugs, broken mechanics, and OP weapons. Not redo the game. Why fix something that isn't broken? All you do is make it so much worse. The game was amazing before this. I would play literally everyday for hours on end because it was so much fun. Now it's been taken over by a terrible new gamemode. We don't want ranked play pushed down our throats, we want the fun back. 

For people thinking about buying this game: Unless they revert this patch or fix what they broke, don't buy this game. Wait for Chivalry 2 or Mount and Blade or something other than this. Don't waste 30 dollars. 

You're not playing what's advertised anymore. If you want to fight 1v1 against enemies that spin, twirl, and use gimmicks to beat you, this is your game. If you're looking for big multiplayer battles like advertised, stay far, far away and wait for something else to come along. 

Please fix this shit devs. Your already shrinking playerbase will only continue to dwindle if you don't.

Here are the ingredients you will need!

Ravioli Dough: 2 cups all-purpose flour, 1 pinch salt, 1 teaspoon olive oil, 2 eggs, 1 1/2 tablespoons water.

Ravioli Filling: 1 (8 ounce) container ricotta cheese, 1 (4 ounce) package cream cheese, softened, 1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, 1/2 cup provolone cheese, shredded, 1 egg, 1 1/2 teaspoons dried parsley.

Pesto-Alfredo Cream Sauce: 2 tablespoons olive oil, 2 cloves garlic, crushed, 3 tablespoons prepared basil pesto sauce, 2 cups heavy cream, 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese, 1 (24 ounce) jar marinara sauce.


1. Mound the flour and salt together on a work surface and form a well. Beat the teaspoon of olive oil, 2 eggs, and water in a bowl. Pour half the egg mixture into the well. Begin mixing the egg with the flour with one hand; use your other hand to keep the flour mound steady. Add the remaining egg mixture and knead to form a dough.

2. Knead the dough until smooth, 8 to 10 minutes; add more flour if the dough is too sticky. Form the dough into a ball and wrap tightly with plastic. Refrigerate for 1 hour.

3. While the dough is resting, prepare the ravioli filling. Combine the ricotta cheese, cream cheese, mozzarella cheese, provolone cheese, egg, and parsley and mix well. Set the filling aside.

4. Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the crushed garlic and pesto sauce and cook for one minute. Pour in the heavy cream, raise the heat to high, and bring the sauce to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Add the Parmesan cheese and stir until the cheese melts. Remove the pan from the heat and keep warm.

5. Meanwhile, in a separate saucepan, warm the marinara sauce over medium-low heat.

6. Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Beat the egg with the tablespoon of water to make the egg wash.

7. Roll out the pasta dough into thin sheets no thicker than a nickel. To assemble the ravioli, brush the egg wash over a sheet of pasta. Drop the filling mixture on the dough by teaspoonfuls about one inch apart. Cover the filling with the top sheet of pasta, pressing out the air from around each portion of filling. Press firmly around the filling to seal. Cut into individual ravioli with a knife or pizza cutter. Seal the edges.

8. Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Stir in the ravioli, and return to a boil. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the ravioli float to the top and the filling is hot, 4 to 8 minutes. Drain well.

9. Grease a baking sheet. Place the cooked ravioli on the sheet pan and bake in the preheated oven until brown, about 4 minutes.

10. To serve the ravioli, divide them among four warmed serving bowls. Drizzle the marinara sauce over the ravioli and then top with the cream sauce.",1492137007,1492137007,True,5,3,0.553691267967224,2,False,True,False,76561198106425300,109,24,3150,0,2563,1575779676

3494042,250760,Shovel Knight: Treasure Trove,18697005,english,"[b]Note:[/b] As of this writing, I've only beaten the Shovel Knight main story, not Plague of Shadows. I'll update this when I've done that. 

[h1]The Short of it:[/h1] It's a fantastic game. If you like platformers, buy this game. If you grew up playing platformers, buy this game. If you grew up playing Mario, Ducktales, Castlevania, Megaman, or even Karnov, buy this game. This is more than your standard lo-fi retro platformer, it's a genuine love letter to an era of gaming largely gone by; The aesthetic and design of ~1988-1993 with 2015 polish. 

[h1]The Long of It:[/h1] I'll be relatively brief beacuse everyone already reccomends this game. Shovel Knight is a game that oozes old school charm in a way that many similar games have failed to. In an era where retro 2D platformers are a dime a dozen (and frequently worth about that much) Shovel Knight somehow manages to avoid riling the kind of fatigue that's associated with this genre right now. It's hard to put my finger on, but if I had to guess, I'd say it's because Shovel Knight seems to be going for more than just an aesthetic; Yacht Club games pulled not just the art and music from the era, not just even some tropes, they went back to classic sources and distilled the good, designed around or cut out the bad, and from it produced a game which is nearly 100% made of the stuff you remember loving about your old games.

 Gone is the unforgiving opacity of Castlevania, but what remains is the clever design around items that turns every encounter into a live action puzzle. Gone is the ""strategic"" wrote memorization and sometimes arcane boss weaknesses of Megaman, but what remains is a level design that teaches you how to play from every jump and a feeling of real progression with persistent powerups. It's really hard not to feel good about Shovel Knight.

Is there anything bad about it, then? Sort of, but nothing truly objectively bad. If you're bad, like me, then getting all of the items can be kind of a grind. Yacht Club does their best to mitigate that with bonus treasure levels and replayable stages, but that can be somewhat hamstrung by being awful at the game. While I'm still kind of in love with their checkpoint system, punishing death with money loss (frequently retrievable as it may be) means that players who deathspam their way through levels may find themselves hard up for cash when it comes time to upgrade. 

That's an incredibly minor grievance and having now beaten the game, I genuinely can't think of any others offhand. It's a good game--nay, it's a great game. It's design borders on perfection, it's incredibly easy to pick up and put down as needed, and it is clearly a labour of love in the best of ways.

1670339,8930,Sid Meier's Civilization V,20330138,english,"I bought the game recently from Steam, as it was on holiday discount. After playing few games I do feel like I shouldn't have. So I can't really recommend this to anyone, especially an experienced Civ player, or a strategy game player.

I've played Civ games since the first one and even modded Civ 2 & 3, but Civ V is a true disappointment. I don't recall the AI being so passive and dumb in previous titles. Basically it's just not there. There are fine historical units for each civilization, but because AI is so passive you don't get to see them in action. 

You get to witness how barbarian archers take down AI player's swordsmen, who just sit there while all they need to do is attack them once or twice, as archers are quite defenseless. 

You get to witness how other civilizations create three cities, not more, and leave half of their land undeveloped. 

Also, you will experience crashes because of several reasons. I have very up-to-date gaming laptop and haven't had so many problems with any other game I've played. A crash per hour, I would say. Even after you do what they advice you to do, which is  turn down parts of game to avoid crashes - which is a ridiculous attempt to fix a problem. It's like if a car manufacturer would say ""Your car's headlights don't work? Well, just remove them!""

The game is sugarcoated enough, nice graphics, nice unit & leaderhead animations, nice music and nice ambient sounds etc. but it's quite unplayable due to poor AI and crashes.",1452019375,1452019375,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198007978800,95,30,6458,0,2635,1453335079

The narrative is completly linear, but very interesting and weird. Coupled with the many real life actors involved, the superb motion capture and face animation, and the photorealistic graphics, the experience is between watching an author sci-fi movie and playing a game.

The map is vast and open - yet dangerous. In Kenshi you never know whether not seeing any enemies is a good or bad sign. 
Combat doesn't end when both sides are on the ground, it ends when either side stops getting back up. This is the spirit of the entire game: keep holding on. No matter how well you prepare, you will get knocked down and you will get back up. This game reminds me of my life, besides I never try to get back up.

Lore and faction design is very comfortable - devs don't shy away from saying whatever the f they want, completely disregarding the threat of public backlash. Take a drunk redneck spitting out his most shallow of thoughts, add a little insane humour, plate armour and giant swords and you've got the Holy Nation, one of the major factions.

My friends and i played the game mostly all day today and had a great time, just noticed a few things that really stoped us from makeing any progress. for instense once in awhile about every 2 or 3 hours things would really start getting choppy, bad enough so that we would have to quit out and re load our current game. whe we did that the doors would be gliched right out like 10 of them right on top of eachother and we couldnt walk into them. trees would disapear from our tree houses, trees we cut down before we re loaded wouldnt be there on my screen, but on my friends they would be, but he couldnt cut them down. fires sometimes wont stay going and ive never been able to light a bon fire, which is very dissapointing because fire is probably one of the most key points of the game. esspecially at night. bon fires should light the place up nice and bright. 
     another thing i noticed is when i place walls, if it is on a hill it will connect to the previouse wall i placed but it will still be at the angel of the previouse wall. so it will pretty much be floating in the air connected to the walls on the hill. as well as building stuff like log sleds, ive built them and my friend could see it, logs wont come out of the log sled once placed in them ect... 
    the most trouble we really had was loading multieplayer games with the same guys cus like i said, doors, trees, items, ect will be either gone or glitched out. cant cook on fires, fires wont lite ect. 
    i understand the game is under production, and i seriously appreciat this game. its so creative and i havnt seen one like it yet. to me its all about video games that are as real as they can be and this is pretty close. its just the little stuff like i have mentiond that is keeping us from really being able to enjoy the game. i hope some of these things ive mentiond are a help to you guys. thank you for makeing a game like this! keep up the good work!!

Now I spent about 36.5 Hours in playing this Game, and I have to say, that this Game, it's Content, it's Atmosphere and it's Sounds (which is part of the Atmosphere too, obviously) is by far the most epic experience since a long time. 

Pro:

- Sounds, Music is just nice
- lovely Graphics
- Different Elements, like Farming, Fishing, Mining, Fighting, and the fact that you can have social contacts
- Gameplay is nice, easy to understand the principle
- Storyline is ok, which means how it comes to different things (Don't want to spoiler)
- It's on you how to live your life, and which decisions you make. which influences you life in different ways
- The development is in progress, getting new Content after time

Cons:

Actually, I did not found [u] any [/u] cons which are very considerable. They are still working on the Storyline, and adding new Content to the Game. Yet, i did not experienced any bugs or errors.

------

You have the classic farming experience on a very huge farm area, having animals, while you have social contacts and the Combat/Adventure Feature in the mines.

I think this Game with its features would be much more worth than 15$ (~20 if you buy the Soundtrack DLC too), and I recommend buying this Game if you want to escape your daily routine and having some time where you can lean back, and have a relaxing session of playing this nice game.

5043548,814380,Sekiro™: Shadows Die Twice,84210703,english,"one of most addictive and fun melee combat games. hard and challenging but fair, engagig and fun. 
even after several new game plus cycles bosses can still give you trouble if you don't pay attention and there's few things one can do to make the playthrough harder if needed. 

combat and boss design is great although there are two or three types of bosses that are repeated several times (although they do have some variation from their previous versions thankfully).
progression, upgrading, leveling, level design, placements of items, enemies, locations and pathways is excellent. there's some sandbox elements such as different routes and several hidden pathways often alongside each route. it rewards exploration with upgrades and story telling. enviormental story telling is spot on. 

story itself is solid and graphics are good. optimization seems pretty okay. 
ran mostly 60fps at 1080p with 1070 and i5 with some framedrops in certain large open areas when for first time takign a look at them to load in the stuff. 
music is great and thank God, finally, a ""souls like"" game that also has ambient music instead of boring silence. 

controls on kb&m seems okay although the game needs an option to change out combat art usage keys from left click+right click to something else since you can accidentally go into long animation when all you wanted is to press attack quickly after deflect/block but instead, since you didn't release right click fast enough, you do a combat art instead of normal melee (which usually takes longer, leaving you open to damage). 
ofc you can remove the art and not worry about it. 

one thing that may irritate people (besides difficulty) is that there's a good amount of missable quests and sorts. A decent amount of stuff is hidden behind some sort of action like, eavesdropping, talking, obtaining an item, finishing this before that, etc...
replayability is great even if you did everything you could in your first run. since there's 4 endings, upgrades and materials to get via xp from ng+, do stuff you missed, difficulty scaling and best of all, the ability to give away kuro's charm. which you can do after you complete the game once. 
you can give away the charm at any new game or new game plus start and it will make combat even more challenging and fun by mainly making you take some damage when you block instead of deflect.

the boss rush mode is loads of fun and inner version of bosses at end of those rush modes are the greatest thrill (inner versions have new moves, ai, etc...).
as for online, there is only a system that let's you record a recording of your actions and write a message then leave a kunai on floor for someone to activate it and see the message and ""hologram"" of the other player moving around and stuff. basically to help new players find stuff or such and vice versa. 
it's a singleplayer game. and a damn good one at that too. 

this is, what they call, a souls like game. So be ready to refund after 2 hours when first boss kills you 20+ times in case you don't play reaction time games often. If you are somewhat more then decent at games and enjoy a challenge and a well made game then sekiro is a great choice. 

I have a few hundred hours already on it on my other account I think. It's super addictive when the combat clicks and you get better and better at it.
gameplay overall is awesome, with okay visuals, sound, story, progression and exploration to keep you busy and entertained for a good while. 

I only wish it was a bit longer or had dlc since playtime depends on your skill level. But most will get between 25 and 45 hours if not more. considering you try to do all optional side stuff as mcuh as possible and go for better ending first run.


I still somehow find tiny bits of game I never encountered after replaying it nearly ten times. 
And game keeps up the difficulty with your ""powerful-ness"" well enough. 
Majority of game is fun to play over and over if you liked the combat. Bugs are few and minor. Loading times seem quick enough. Save function works flawlessly (saving everything you do, even location from where you left off usually). You can have multiple save files. You can play without internet ofc and disable onlin messages thingy or just not watch/read them. There aren't too many keybinds to mess about and enough graphics settings to tweak. player control feels pretty good ofc. textures and animations are also good.

stealth aspect of game is really neat. you can basically go through many non-boss areas sneak playstyle.
the whole health and posture thing with deflecting and coping with perilous attacks is well made and executed. enemy AI seems good in majority of game. voice acting is nice. cinematic/ambient music fits well. 
combat music isn't too repetitive. skills and tools add een more flavour and layers to combat. yeah. all in all a fantastic game.

p.s. sorry for shitty wall of typos text review.

- If you like Borderlands, this is the best iteration of the Borderlands gameplay yet.
-- It is however, more Borderlands, so don't expect any major changes in gameplay loop.
-- Mayhem 10 is still quite unbalanced, and favors specific builds. That, and a bug-turned-feature-in-testing that made enemies wield Mayhem 10 weapons is also pretty unfair for how bullet spongy they already are.
- If you don't like Borderlands, this game most likely won't convince you to like the series.
- If you're interested in Borderlands' story, forget it (it sucks really bad). If you like Borderlands' lore, this expands the lore further but maybe not in the way you like.

Very awe inspiring landscapes which may be indentical to the European-German-Italy-Poland regions of the world.  For the single player experince, Deliveries are very time effecttive, and rewarding with respective player leveling, and there are a handful of truck dealer brand selections to interest your liking. A few quirks are the speed traps, the AI traffic is tolerable, although not foolproof, which adds to the challenge of being a safe yet effeict truck driver, and after a few hours, the solo campagin feels too scoiophobia, as it doesnt feature much AI employee interaction or other truck radio chatter conversation along the drive. Other than that, it is a game to enjoy.

Disclaimer: For best experince, you should at least know how to drive in real life to understand trailer movement on a truck, which is minimal experince.

4901181,590380,Into the Breach,40531073,english,"When I saw the announcement for this game, I was hoping for another Invisible Inc. It looked like this game would offer a procedurally generated series of tightly-focused, small-scale puzzles that I would then have to solve using a modestly varied set of tools with a pre-determined, RNGless set of capabilities. Once the pieces were in place, I hoped, I could then plan how a turn would play out to the last exact detail.

Turns out? That's EXACTLY what I got, and I highly recommend this game IF that sounds appealing to you. On the other hand, DO NOT buy this game if you want another FTL. If you want that, play the Captain's Edition mod for FTL instead, if you haven't already (if you have, try A Strange New Galaxy or Stations Job, which offer unique appeals of their own even though they're not as polished or feature-complete as CE).

As far as roguelites go, Into the Breach is fairly light on equipment and enemy variety (variance in general really) and on fleshing out the setting, but is VERY similar to Invisible Inc. in that respect. The two games are almost part-and-parcel in that they are both immensely satisfying little brain teasers where the fun and challenge of the game is in racking your brain for the optimal solution to the situation each turn presents, then feeling so very accomplished indeed when you discover and execute a series of moves that leaves the enemy floundering helplessly, doing no damage to either you or your buildings (or in Invisible Inc.'s case, the guards running around like headless chickens with no idea where your agents are).

Beyond that, Into the Breach has a simple but stylish aesthetic, simple but stylish music courtesy of FTL's composer Ben Prunty, and is generally simple and stylish all the way around. It's a very clean, almost clinical sort of game, but that is, I feel, as it should be for a game of its type, another quality it shares with Invisible Inc. It shows you exactly what you need to know to plan your next move and nothing more, leaving your thinking space free of distractions.

Again, the satisfaction of this game is the intellectual satisfaction of a well-executed plan. If you're looking for the visceral satisfaction of giant robots punching giant bugs, you won't really find that here as the combat animations and sound effects are fairly minimalist (though pushing the monsters into water or chasms never stops being funny). If, on the other hand, you're down for a well-realized puzzle game with a fascinating rule set and a helping of giant robotics on the side, you'd be mad not to check out Into the Breach.

You're alone without help against both nature and the creatures that hunt you down. Even when there are no enemies around at night, the constant wails and screams of cannibals make you wonder if you really are safe in your own shelter.

You can craft, cook food, make weapons, and explore a vast open peninsula with different environments and biomes. Enemies consist of cannibals and mutants, ranging from weak to very strong. Its not at all recommended to fight if there is more than three enemies since they can easily gang up on you. Mutants are huge, powerful, and very aggressive. Killing them can give you some of the best armor in the game. You can tell if they are nearby by listening for loud footsteps and roars.

Know that if you plan to build a quick shelter at night and a mutant is nearby, they can sense your presence inside the shelter and end up either walking into it or try to destroy it. Try to build protection around your shelter if you are in a mutant heavy area.


Only your wits, drive to survive, and bravery of what awaits you, can save your life. The satisfaction in finding random useful things is just unbeatable. GET THIS GAME. Its fun, its visuals are beautiful for a Unity game, and its very well worth it.

I Highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys micomanaging!

This game requires so much thinking and excelent planning that you will find yourself looking at the clock one minute and thinking "" Oh I have ten more minutes, I'll just do this."" then the next time you look you wonder how on earth you stayed up past 2am!
In no way is this a bad thing! You always enjoy the time spent playing this game and tend to come back for more!

The price of this game is so awesome! $20! I mean really?! Who does $20?!? Most games go for $19.99... I mean really?! why $19.99 and not just add the penny?!

These guys are honest and active! I have seen them say things like development time was lost to a silly game we found and they really mean it! lol Its great, they are real people out to do what any of us would if we could program a game.

Pros:
-2015 game with graphics better than most games out today
-A stock 1050TI paired with an i5-8300H can run this game on ultra 1080P without NVidia hairworks enabled
-Potentially hundreds, if not, thousands of hours of content embedded within the world of Witcher.
-The most perfect combat system. Everything just... works.

Cons:
-You'll hate every other game after beating it, let alone playing it.
-You're going to skip out on homework
-You're going to sit all day playing Witcher, and eventually feel burnt out. Yet you WILL come back and finish the game, either for the story or for completion.

Overall, great game 9.8/10

Gripes so far: seriously unbalanced, frustrating, and feels very closed-off and limited compared to previous versions. This is a personal opinion but I *hate* the art style. World leaders are rendered as silly, cartoony goofs (who want to nuke you, by the way), the map is an utter visual disaster...it's like a pixel lasagna, layer after layer of graphics that look good on their own, but turn into a melted mush when combined; the net effect is that it's difficult to tell at a glance exactly what or who you're looking at. Music is so-so; probably an odd thing to complain about, but since you're stuck with it for hours and hours at a given time, it'd be nice if it wasn't so grating (seriously, banjos have little place in the real world, let alone in a video game). And worst of all...it's kinda boring. Never before in the series have I felt so robotic in every task I was doing. I feel less like a leader playing this game and more like an overworked shift supervisor at a toy-soldier factory. 

There are good things to say about this game...though at the moment they all escape me. To be fair, I will probably revisit this game in a few years, and either it will have improved, or my tastes will have evolved, but for now, I'm going back to Civ V.",1506738851,1506738851,False,2,0,0.479504764080048,0,True,False,False,76561198019283300,266,34,2701,0,2416,1520222252

alright for real though. This game has A LOT more depth to it than just farming. You don't JUST farm - You bond with a community, you become a master of fishing, you explore and conqur a haunting cave, you make hard choices and sacrafices, you succeed, you fail, you unlock the secrets of stardew valley.

I'm talking like I've already done all this. No. I'm 15 hours in and I have a long, long, long ways to go. The slow pace of the game innicially turned me off, but probably because it wasn't the right time for me to jump in. Despite its slow pace, this is a game you can easily stay up the entire night playing until sunrise.

This incredible software changes your boring desktop to a mind-blowing dynamic heaven. and it doesnt really eat a lot of performance at all, there are a ton of custom wallpapers avaible on the workshop
(most notably a fuckton of waifus for you otaku-weebs out there)
They also allow for a bit of niché customizations if you wish for that

All in all: Wallpaper engine is a great software to enhance your daily desktop experiences. buy it now for a small €4.-
Pros:
-Gorgeous high quality dynamic wallpapers
-Endless extra wallpapers in the workshop (and a lot of waifus!)
-Uses a suprising small amount of performance
-Easy to use.
-More features to come

Cons:
-Some wallpapers MIGHT be a bit distracting.
-You may find yourself staring at your beutifal wallpaper for too long causing you to die of hunger, water-shortage, not working at your job, keeping your GF happy, watching your favourite anime (thomas the train), playing games. and for being a lonely wimp.

You play the role of a character whom has moved to the small town of Pellican Town and has begun a life on their now deceased grandfather's farm. It's a game very similar to Harvest Moon/ Rune Factory mixed with a little Animal Crossing from what I understand (haven't actually gotten to play either of those before).

Pros -
 - Very nice art style
 - Nice calming atmosphere, I have yet to run into anything that makes me feel frustrated.
 - A lot of stuff to do
 - Not very grindy (you do repeat tasks often, as you would expect, but nothing really feels like a grind)
 - A lot of interesting characters
 - Four Seasons with a completely different feel to each (different crops to grow, town events, and exploration aspects)
 - You can play as long as you want (The seasons will just keep going, so you can do whatever you want)
 - Doesn't really hold your hand
 - Story can be started whenever you want, or even never (I'm about 20 hours in and haven't progressed the story at all by choice)
 - Replayable (There's two different stories from what I understand and many different ways to run your farm and different characters you can marry in game.)

Cons - 
 - The tasks do get repetitive (although I don't really care some may)
 - The combat is kind of clunky
 - The pets are sorely lacking (can only pet them and fill their water bowl)
 - The general dialogue you can have with people feels lacking at times

All in all it is a very great game that I think is definitely worth the asking price, it seems like it takes about 40 hours to complete your first game and then probably somewhere around 20-30 for your second (assuming you want to see both stories) and the fact that you can play as long as you want is really great.

5006957,397540,Borderlands 3,70343690,english,"Get it on sale, seriously.

Borderlands 3 is a game which has fun gameplay, but too many downsides to make it worthwhile for now.

First off, the game runs horrid. Low fps for graphics which could easily be ran better. I am struggling to get 60fps on a GTX 1070 on mid settings. Which is above the recommended. Sometimes it dips towards the 40s.

The story itself has potential that is just wasted on every place, the main antagonist barely interact with the player itself, you barely matter in the plot, with moments where you are wondering why your characters aren't doing anything in cutscenes while a character dies. 

Some new characters get added and get pushed hard, giving off a sense that the game wants you to like these characters, which really isn't working. 

The story is about lilith and the sirens, which is doable I suppose. but fails to do anything with it. You go from planet to planet, completing missions of which some really are filler. At the end, something 'heroic' and 'dramatic' happened and the game acts like it was a big moment, but it isn't. As the character which it is about did nothing nearly nothing throughout the story which actually helped the characters.

Gameplay wise, the game is alright. Guns feel good to shoot, character abilities are fun and have more depth compared to the other entries in the franchise. Barring some balance issues between characters, the game is fun.

BUT, the game is also incredibly easy throughout the story. There aren't any moments where it is a challenge to beat it.

Bosses are hit or miss. A handful are fun and have unique attacks which allow for fun gameplay moments which don't simply consist of shooting the bad guy till he dies. Sadly these bosses either die to quickly thanks to the aforementioned lack of challenge. 

Other bosses are just boring. So simple that you can just keep shooting without much effort, after which it goes into a invulnerable phase which is either short or incredibly long. (To keep it vague: The boss which physically transforms between all phases). Which brings me to another point:

There are many, MANY moments in this game where you are gonna be standing still, waiting for the characters to finish talking and allowing you to complete the objective and such. This game kills any fun you have on second playthroughs by forcing you to wait for minutes  at a time between objectives, missions and combat sections. YOU WILL SPEND AT LEAST 3 HOURS WITHOUT ANYTHING HAPPENING. Wether it is driving from A to B without much interesting happening, waiting for lilith to stop talking again, waiting for a animation to finish and more. As said before, this becomes tiring the moment you want to replay the game with another character you like, and more. 

You might ask yourselves why I give it a negative review even after I played 70+ hours, this is because there are other games you can spend your money on which offer more fun for the cash required. Such as Borderlands 2.

So to repeat what I said at the beginning: Buy this on sale.",1591379140,1591379140,False,10,0,0.552496731281281,5,False,False,False,76561198042786700,251,5,5074,0,4241,1607461989

3745452,583470,The End Is Nigh,53969612,english,"The End is Nigh is a game by Edmund McMillen and Tyler Glaiel. If you're an indie games fan then you've at least heard about Ed. In my humble opinion this game is a masterpiece and definitely the best of his games. Keep reading if you want to find out why!

The atmosphere is rather gloomy, the Earth is dead and so are you, probably. By ""you"" I meant Ash, the protagonist black blob missing an eye. His last game cartridge finally breaks and so Ash is forced to go out. I haven't played any other game with that kind of feel. It is dark as I said, but also silly. Ghosts are kinda cute, too!

You explore varied areas, encounter more and more hazards, find secret places and chat with NPCs, including some characters known from Ed's previous games (as always!). Nearly every level, or rather screen has a tumor that you can collect. Secret areas can have mega tumors and/or game cartridges you can later play on your console. Cartridges are just harder levels with retro graphics and music that you can play at any time.

Graphics are really great, I love them. The music is gorgeous, too! I wasn't very pleased with Ridiculon's Isaac: Rebirth soundtrack, but oh boy they absolutely blown my head away with this one. Heavy guitar remixes of classic pieces, originally writen by ""buncha dead dudes"". Makes you shiver, for real!

Nice things:
+ Varied areas, secrets, NPCs
+ Unique feel
+ Tough as nails, you saw it coming didn't you?
+ Really great soundtrack

Wack things:
- Even though you can disable particle and some additional effects to improve FPS, ingame menu won't let you do all of these. You need to access .ini configuration file in game folder and add several lines. Look it up if you struggle with performance
- If you're more of a casual gamer then this game might not be for you. That's it, really

Okay so extra section. Everyone compares this to Super Meat Boy, so will I. I will start with saying that this is not SMB 2. 
This game is not even close to SMB, really. I'll tell you why.
▪ SMB has sprint, TEiN doesn't

322741,292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,41652002,english,"Not too much to say, just as everyone in the review section has been stating this game is a masterpiece.
The visuals: graphics, the setting, scenery.
The audio: music, sound effects, voice acting ( dwarves <3) the exception being a bunch of voices in Touissaint, mostly knights, it feels as if they've just hired a bunch of random swedes to voice them.
The story presentation, dialogue.
Gwent!
etc etc etc, all amazing


With that said, here's a few specific things that stood out to me.

The hand crafted camera angles during quests/dialogue add this ""cinematic"" feeling, they show you some great scenery and backdrops and are just amazing, especially when you compare them to something like fallout where the camera during dialogue is completely static.

Just as many other open world games this game has a lot of side activities. But compared to those other games in which the side activities consist of you collecting a bunch of random shite unusable collectibles with no attached backstory or clearing 100 similarly looking camps of the same 5 generic dudes. (All of which just exist so that companies could say ""this game has 200 hours of content!"", looking at you Ubisoft :) ) 
Compared to those, most side activities in the Witcher have some storytelling attached to them (especially in the expansions) either through notes on the loot or prop placement around the location. These stories revolve around people in this universe, their lives, a trouble they might've gotten themselves in, a message that they wanted to relay to someone... These narrative bits usually don't have any connection to the main story of the game or Geralt himself but they add a lot towards the feeling that this is a living breathing world and while that might not be interesting to some players, having some context added to murdering a bunch of seemingly random mobs is always better than just having target dummies. Same as how collecting hidden recipes/swords/armor is more interesting than collecting some useless unusable trash that exists just to artifically increase play time.

Plenty of RPGs attempt to give you an illusion of choice but they do it in a lazy way with barely any effort placed into hiding that fact. Usually by showing completely the same dialogue/cutscenes no matter what decisions you've made previously.
Well, even though this game also uses the illusion of choice technique, it's not felt as strongly as in other titles because effort has been put intohiding it. And i think it really contributes to the feeling that your actions actually matter.

No hand holding when it comes to morality.


Cool little details/features

The way Geralt slides downhill is awesome and more games should take this approach.
The dialog skip is not bound to the same button as choosing the next line of dialogue, which prevents you from getting into situations where you accidently select the next line of dialogue when really, you just wanted to skip dialogue.
Dialogue choices which will end the dialogue (or get you to the next stage of dialogue).
The automatic movement of horses along paths where you don't have to steer them constantly along those paths (not perfectly executed but solid implementation and a great idea overall).
I don't think i've seen better implementation of trees and their bending in a game than in the Witcher, especially when you combine it with the amazing sound design.It truly feels special.

DUALSHOCK BUTTON LAYOUT

Small negatives

Too many fighting and racing minigames. They were nice at first but have overstayed their welcome.
Fall damage, Geralt isn't capable of falling from anything higher than 2 meters without dying, what?
The UI is cluttered, finding the exact potion or an item you want unless you remember them by their image is aids and the same applies to your ""buff bar"".
There were more but i cannot think of any of them of the top of my head right now.

Thankfully most small issues can be fixed with mods and this game has great mod support.

The big ""bad"" thing 

The combat.
Just as the first 2 games had mediocre combat at best to terrible at worst, i'd have to say this game follows those steps. The main major improvement is definitely the ability to use potions during combat.(which doesn't fit the lore, but in a game, gameplay comes first, right?) It does improves on the previous titles by a bit but it's mostly just from the production quality standpoint. 
The combat stays very spammy with an extremely small variety of moves, fast and slow attacks and rend and whirlwind as your ""finishers"". And that is really sad considering the amount of ways in which you can modify your character (4 different ""talent trees"", runeforging, mutations, set bonuses, stats). None of that matters if the base of your combat system is meh. Crossbows are pointless and don't really have a use except for underwater combat and getting flying beasts grounded. Signs are nice and all but they are quite weak (from my experience) and once again, you don't have a lot of options, you've got 2 choices for cc 1 ""pure"" defensive and 2 offensive ones. So, is combat shit? No. Is it average? Eh...i don't know...maybe it's average or somewhat good? (when you include all the ways in which you can improve/modify your character with talents/sets etc)
But when all the other aspects of your game are amazing, the Witchers combat being average is a letdown. Not to the extent that you can't enjoy it or that there is no variety in it at all, but still a letdown. Especially if you do not forget that at the end of the day, combat is the ""heart"" of the game.


So yeah, if there's anything at all to complain about in this game it's definitely the combat.

Nevertheless, as stated by so many people this game is a masterpiece. It's a must own if you're into RPGs and we really should commend and support devs such as CD Projekt Red for the work they've put it into this project. The free DLC, the expansions oozing with content... A company being this good to it's customers is really an exception rather than the rule these days.",1524528419,1565301048,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198050184500,360,26,8790,0,8730,1523809598

I saw some people that said the story was bad... no it isn't, it's very nice and heartwarming when you get farther into it. I also saw people saying the music was annoying and that has to be personal opinion because I love it, although i don't like the music as much in chapter 3 everywhere else it is amazing.

I feel as though Celeste excels at what it sets out to do when it goes for more self contained rooms that last around 2 minutes to pass through with fairly simple yet challenging platforming, and fails at what it sets out to do when you find yourself in longwinded horizontally scrolling rooms with several obstacles, with one death sending you all the way to the beginning, which can quickly grow infuriating should you be near the end and slip up.

2893942,242760,The Forest,54950101,english,"This game will scare you and it will also leave you wanting to know more and more as you progress. Read on if you wish. But TL:DR, its a good game with the occasional bugs here and there, but most can shrugged off if you play with friends. Buy it and play it alone for maximum fear or with friends to experience fear and funny moments together! I recommend this game! Oh and spoilers ahead!  

So we start off 'naked' and afraid. With a sh*t axe and some supplies from the plane, you begin your survival in the harsh island known as Peninsula. As you progress through the story, you'll find vague clues about what happened to the previous people that came there. You gotta explore though, its scary but you gotta do it or else you'll be stuck in the same place until you grow a beard and start talking to to the rocks.

Exploring is really really refreshing. All the caves are well done. Though there were some caves that were meh but they still managed to scare me and my friends. But in terms of exploring the island, that's where it gets fun. It can disorienting trying to find certain places because there's a sh*t load of trees, hence the name right? lel. 

In terms of AI, after awhile, they become smarter or atleast they seem to be, which increases your paranoia and fear. They'll ambush you when you least expect it and if you do things right, you'll get to see the FUN GUYS come to the surface and wreck your stuff. 

Items. Plentiful but, obviously as i mentioned, there are bugs and exploits but I won't need to tell you the exploits because you'll find out what they are on your own. BUGS, items disappearing when you load the game, some clues you can't pickup in caves which hinders your progression and lore knowledge and items sometimes drop out of the world and into the void. Which happened to me once after I killed my first rabbit. But hey, I fell from the sky afterwards, the rabbit? Did not. But meh, forgivable since there are tons of rabbits. Oh and to the devs, this is like the biggest issue I've had throughout my entire almost 60 hour playthrough. FIX THE DAMN LOG SLED! The thing is the most useful yet buggiest piece of shi* in Single and Multi Player.

Storyline? Vague but it manages to keep you wanting more. Like what happened to the people before us? Why are there so many tents? Why are the cannibals scared of The Red God? Oops. You have to find that out yourself. It was unpredictable and a bit sad at the same time. Not too sad though, you'll just feel bad the more you find out.

In terms of gameplay, yeah it does get repetitive but that's why the devs put caves and AI that seems to get smart. Explore and find ways to deal with the cannibals in Peninsula. I wish they added modding support, cause as of now, once you've built all there is to build and experiment with all ways to die, there isn't much to do after you finish the story. Except play it on Hard or Hard Survival, they both arent that different from each other, devs work your magic and make it harder please. Oh and if you plan on playing it again on different difficulties, I suggest you leave the game for a few days, get it off your mind and then play it again. That's how I get to feel the fear rush through me again while playing. Oh and I almost forgot, there are lots of visual bugs in multiplayer. Like imagine fallout face glitch but this happens while climbing the walls in caves, besides that, there's one bug where everyone in the server suddenly has the same face even after they died. Which is hilarious at first but then it gets stale.

All in all, if you stayed with me until here. Thank you for reading. I give this game a 4 out of 5 star rating cause bugs man. PS: This might get edited if there are any changes to the game.

All these bug fixes, and it still hasn't stopped them from being warmongering, religious zealots. Next, the game has yet to be cross compatible, leaving me to play the horribly flawed single player or Civ V instead. The game has been out for a little more than a year now, it's a shame. Finally, the DLC, which is the worst of all. 7 DLC civs that add up to a total of $32.95, not including tax? Absolutely ridiculous. Not to mention the balancing issues some of these civs have like Poland and Australia. Overall, Civ VI is a flop of a game and a bad addition to the Civilization franchise.

The landscape is beautiful but the cities are rather simple (not really a big deal though since you spend most of your time on highways).

Simulation is more on the arcade side, with the possibility of adjusting many parameters to increase the simulation level. With some practice, anyone should be able to drive well. It's highly recommended to play this game with a steering wheel or a controller.

Pacing is very relaxing; you'll spend most of your time managing the truck speed and route. Play your favorite song or podcast and enjoy the travel.

The modding community is awesome; you'll be able to completely overhaul your experience with more realism, cargo variety, truck models and maps, but the vanilla game should provide you many hours of fun.

KOJIMA PRODUCTIONS with a creschendo furioso at the beginning of the studio history.

Finally he is allowed to let off steam completely and cast himself in almost every role on the set... (as a talent like him is entitled to do in his own company). On the side I get to know and appreciate Norman Reedus and I'm looking forward to the scenes with Mads Mikkelsen, who acts en point where Norman Reedus will probably end up - in the ""Hell of Fame"" of the biggest likeable outsiders. Both of them put into Kojima's tracking suit and dancing perfectly to the beat of the typical abstruse MGS- Parallel/ SCP world overture. The result is a completely unique Mind♥♥♥♥♥ in technical, but above all in game-mechanical terms. Somewhere between Neo Geo Evangelion, The Manchurian Candidate, and Located in a land before our time, the story is oppressive and partly rippling and then again there comes the one moment where you have to clearly recognize - Let the Kojima run... it needs leash. Best adult story driven wanderlust simulation since Cosmos Cosmic Adventure...

Of course, I'm only making this up for my Steam Award trophy.
Finally, a tip for new corona-tested hydraulic engineering fathers. There is a baby that looks pretty real and needs to be taken care of. It is thereby partly wanted an emotional Rollercoaster for the own child at least toward potty age on the way should be around sufficient distance to the Tasache to have that it is a completely beautiful energy act full concern, fear and feel helplessly to care for a baby. Otherwise it could be quite heavy when you are so close. So emotional and so. All the others. Cheer up, laced up your boots.

From me a smooth 10/12.

KOJIMA PRODUCTIONS mit einen Creschendo furioso zum Auftakt der Studiogeschichte.

Endlich darf er sich vollkommen austoben und so ziemlich jede Rolle am Set mit sich selbst besetzten... (wie es einem Talent wie Ihm in der eigenen Firma auch zusteht). Nebenbei lerne ich Norman Reedus kennen und schätzen und freue mich auf die Szenen mit Mads Mikkelsen der ziemlich genau en point da schauspielert wo Norman Reedus vermutlich mal landen wird - in der ""Hölle of Fame"" der größten likeable outsiders. Beide von Kojima in den Tracking Anzug gesteckt und perfekt zum Takt der typisch abstrusen MGS- Parallel/ SCP-Welt Ouvertüre tanzend. Was dabei rauskommt ist ein in technischer, aber vor allem spielmechanischer Hinsicht- völlig einzigartiger Mindfuck. Irgendwo zwischen Neo Geo Evangelion, Der Manchurian Kandidat und In einem Land vor unserer Zeit verortet, ist die Geschichte drückend und teilweise plätschernd verlaufend und dann wieder kommt der eine Moment wo man klar annerkennen muss- Lasst den Kojima laufen... der braucht Leine. Beste erwachsene Story driven Wanderslust Simulation seit Cosmos Cosmic Adventure...

Natürlich saug ich mir den Brei nur für meine Steam Award Trophäe aus den Fingern. 
Als Abschluss noch ein Tipp für frischgebackene Korona geprüfte Wasserbau Väter. Es kommt ein Baby vor, das ziemlich echt wirkt und um das sich gekümmert werden muss. Es ist dadurch teilweile gewollt ein emotionaler Rollercoaster für den das eigene Kind mindestens Richtung Töpfchenalter unterwegs sein sollte um genügend Abstand zu der Tasache zu haben, dass es ein ganz schöner Kraftakt voller Sorge, Angst und sich hilflos fühlen ist, ein Baby zu versorgen. Sonst könnte es ziemlich heavy werden wenn man noch so nah dran ist. So emotional und so. Alle anderen. Heiter auf, die Stiefel geschnürt.

At it's core its a fun and fast paced game that will test your skills. Each chapter captivates the player in it's colorful and interesting environment. Each of these levels feels different from the other. New levels come with new mechanics that keep the game fresh as it captures your attention. It's challenging and unique. This game offers an experience to each kind of player. Whether you are a casual, hardcore, or completionist gamer, this game has something for you. 
-For the casual players there's a cute and lovable story as you travel in the boots of Madeline, a girl set out to climb Celeste, a tall and snowy mountain. If you struggle there is an assist mode to help you get through any tough obstacles. You'll never feel like you're missing out of the story! 
-For the hardcore gamers you can enjoy beating each level with a sense of accomplishment as each level gets progressively more challenging. Along the way you can acquire strawberries, a collectable item that displays above each chapter. These strawberries require that you beat certain rooms that are more tricky or challenging than usual offering great hardcore gameplay.
-For the completionists out there you're in for the treat when you discover that each stage has a much more challenging ""B-side,"" 
levels that have the same atmosphere as the original, but task you with technical precision and quick thinking. Every level also contains a secret heart that awards the player with a heart icon on the chapter select screen. Don't even get me started on the true challenge that awaits you after ""beating"" the game. The extra content towards the end of the game makes it feel like you're not even half way done!
Over all my experience with this game has been phenomenal. I'm so glad that we live in a time where you can find small gems such as Celeste. I'd honestly consider this one of my favorite games of all time. I consider this wonderful game a true masterpiece and hope that you can experience the same feeling that I did at the very start of the prologue.

This means it's all you are going to do, make food and water. That's it. It is a shame because it's actually a really nice world to explore but the crafting simply robs you of real exploration. 

There is a mode allowing you to explore without the need to craft things to survive but playing this mode feels like your missing out on part of the experince that costs 20 bucks in the first place.

Also there is no surround sound so this ruins the atmosphere for me. Once again, it's a shame because the audio is actually good quality.

3633260,367520,Hollow Knight,75927267,english,"Allow me to parrot what everyone else is saying. Yeah. This game gud. Now for a brief breakdown:

Appearance/artstyle/'''graphics''': Basically Tim Burton (Morbid but Cute) meets Studio Ghibli (Gorgeously detailed and fluidly animated). Just look at those screenshots and tell me you can't make a wallpaper out of every single one of them.

Plot: more lore than plot, comes with being a soulslike. You get what you make of it, but if you do choose to engage, you'll find an intriguing world, likeable characters, and a narrative that will make a thought or two pass through your head.

Gameplay: Tight. Tight. Tight! This game just feels good to play. You're always in control in both platforming and combat (And I'm saying that as someone who beat the game with a mouse and keyboard), which is good because they intertwine. Your attacks feel meaty no matter how weak they are. It's simple, but there's a lot of depth to it and a variety of strategies you can use. It's challenging but it's fair, yada yada yada. The one criticism I see is that some isolated parts (ahem Godmaster) are significantly harder than the rest of the game. But I disagree since I managed to beat the Godmaster dlc (even if it took an embarrassingly long time) and I'm utterly garbage at videogames. So get, um... better.

(Also you can break every part of the scenery you pass by and that's always satisfying. Just a bonus)

Since I bought this game as part of a humble bundle, I'm pretty much obligated to buy Silksong at launch now, even if I won't like that game (which is not very likely). I'm in debt now because I DIDN'T spend a lot of money. That's what this game did to me.

You can build houses, or have a blast killing traitors. If you are new and just looking to find a feel for the game there is many noob friendly servers that have lots of fun and enjoyable people that are willing to help you along the way. Although at first this game might seem a bit different and confusing its really actually quite simple. 

There are two main gamemodes that are the most populated and simple out of any, although there is also many others such as Prop-hunt or Stop it Slender. Dark Rp and TTT (Trouble in Terrorist Town) are the two that most people find themselves playing for the majority of there time on Garry's Mod.

Dark Rp is a city like semi-serious rp gamemode enviroment. There are many one of a kind custom servers that always have a twist that the others dont. Some are serious and some are just there to waste time and troll.

TTT (Trouble in Terrorist Town) is more of a first person shooter type game. It consists of three random classes that you are randomly assigned at the beggining of he round. Innocent, Detective, and Traitor
        Innocent: As an innocent you are supposed to just hunt around and try to catch the traitors killing one of your buddies and just being in the wrong ally with the wrong body.
       Detective: You are similar to the innocent but you are given tools to help find the traitors
       Traitor (fun): You are given the role of killing everyone that isnt a traitor (usually there is a few of you working together)             and you are given specal weapons that others dont have like knives crossbows and some others that will help you along the way.

Civilization V is my first game in the Civilization series and now that I got it I don't Understand why I never played the others.

You start the game off with one group of settlers and a warrior to protect them, from there you start building your civilization.
It's not like other strategy games where you literally build every single building, the map is devided into Hexagonal tiles with different resources, all you have to do is build your settlement and from there on expand to the surrounding tiles, as you play you unlock new buildings to upgrade your settlements, you can found new settlements as freely as you like but you always run risk of attack so make sure you have the proper amount of troops to protect those new found bottom feeding settlements of yours.

There are 5 ways to win the game: Domination victory, Science victory, Cultural victory, Diplomatic victory or a Score Victory.
But this means there are 5 ways for you to get beaten as well so you will need to not only keep an eye on your own civilization but your enemy's aswell, and know exactly when it's time to attack or ally up.

If you get tired of the standard game check out the scenarios, that is where the real fun begins, with scenario's that actually happened like the Boers vs the Zulu's in Africa, the Mayan's who feared the end of the world and all the troubles they faced like the french invading them with weapons they have never even seen before in their lives, the scenario's have it all.

And if that's not enough, Civilization V supports the steam workshop so there are endless mods for you to choose from to spice your game up even more.

The game is very easy to learn with the help of your advisers who even though they can be pretty annoying sometimes, make sure you know what you are doing and what the Consequences will be if you take a certain action. They will take good care of you.

My Rating 9/10 - (-1 the game sometimes feels like it's taking forever to finish, but there are settings to change the game speed which will sort this out for you, but I found that on Standard settings the game takes forever and on quick settings you can't help but feel extremely rushed. It would have been nice to have something in between. )

So, initially Rebirth was a really, really well crafted game. Yes, it had it's flaws, but it was still fun to play.
After all of it's ""Updates"" the game is now in a terrible state. And I'm not talking about bugs.
I'm talking about damn bad game design.
Of course - since it's a rogue-like - it's not supposed to be a walk in the park and I like challenging games even better than walking simulators.
So, what am I talking about?
- There are rooms, you DEFINITELY get damage in. So if you are not lucky(!) enough to have been given the right items to survive (a thing the game decides - not the player), you die.
- By the time many bullet sponge enemies were added. Instead of creating a new challenge / new enemies in a creative way, the developers seem to have ""thought"", that it's more fun to have enemies that take like 30 hits until they die.
• Talking about enemies... Isaac was never a bullet hell game. Nevertheless the developers ""thought"" that this would be a great feature to add. No, it's not. Those bullet hell bosses and rooms just don't work with this game.
- Overall (and after 800+ hours in this game) I kinda get the feeling that the game sometimes let's you win - and other times it's like in a troll mode or something. Then there suddenly seem to be no i-Frames, you take damage though not being hit and/or the game won't give you like a single key (but just when it's all you need).

In conclusion nowadays it feels like you only can have fun with this game, if the game wants you to have fun. And that's not my philosophy when it comes to gaming. Also knowing it was different back in the days...

TL,DR: Buy only if you have a time machine to go back to previous builds of the game. Nowadays it's just not that much fun anymore - sadly.",1446455730,1556734273,False,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,76561197968866100,420,64,57998,0,50241,1609187066

    This developer and game has been amazing. From a development standpoint this is how Indie games should be handled. Every single major update brought major new content to the game and with the content loads of fun. The developer has actively worked with the community and the community has worked hard to improve his game. The game was fun from start to end of the development and well done.

    From a gameplay standpoint, the design and idea behind Rimworld is amazing. The story-teller system and the combat system were the two biggest parts of rimworld that kept it stressfull, fun, and hillarious as other reviews have shown.

2703328,240720,Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy,60591176,english,"Super rage - for real.  The reason I wouldn't recommend isn't because it's a rage game; it's because of the *mechanics* of the controls (not the controls themselves).  The mouse is your only control and it's how you move about; the problem is the position you move your mouse to becomes dynamic, in that it doesn't remain in it's intended position - that's why I'm giving a thumbs down.  

Imagine moving your cursor on your desktop then you stop, while your mouse is physically sitting still, your mouse cursor moves back a few inches on screen; that's exactly what happens in-game.  It throws off the cursor location in relation to the physical position of the mouse - so the next thing you know, the mouse is almost off your desk while you're trying to get your guy to move.  

It feels like a hidden mechanic that was intentionally designed to make this a rage game.  Unlike the in-game dialogue which claims getting over the obstacles themselves was the challenge and he left them there because of it.  The obstacles aren't the problem, the mechanics of the controls are; there is no option to tighten up the correlation between mouse and cursor, only to increase mouse sensitivity (which does help a bit, but not nearly enough).

Congratulations to all of you who decided to stick with it and beat the game.

Edit: If you turn on mouse tracking sync (or whatever it's called) then the controls become much more manageable.  Unfortunately, the game still isn't fun.  The jankiness is still in the controls to a much less degree, but still there, and the consequences for making a mistake with these controls is far too dire, which means the game still isn't fun.

I now have noticeable stutters on my rtx2070 super, various small bugs and the whole forum is once again mad; but nothing will change. I cannot recommend this game anymore, as it is only getting worse over time. Do not support these devs.


Original Review:

I'll start with all the issues I have with the game:

- Smoke is [b]always[/b] bugged. When I started playing this game in spring, smoke would just vanish suddenly. They claimed to have fixed it (they didn't), then when they managed to fix it, they introduced a new bug: At random occasions some players can see silhouettes through the smoke, giving them a huge advantage. This is very frustrating and completely unacceptable in a game which requires you to use smoke.

- The game is terribly optimized. After some fixes I found in the forums and guides I could get it to run well, but at first I had around 100 fps (on medium, with an RTX 2070 Super) with sudden drops to below 30 fps. Then the game would just run at 25-50 fps until I restarted the game.

- The PvP mode Push is the only game mode which is fun for me. Competitive mode only exists for one of the main game modes.

- Cheaters can reach lvl 72 (for reference, I'm lvl 85 or so after 100 h) without getting banned. There's nothing you can do about it either, since they can just rejoin after getting kicked.

- Low player count. In Europe, it can happen that there is only one server with people on a workday. I have never managed to play a round of Competitive, because it is never populated.

- Lvl is purely time-based. No matter how good or bad you are, 99% of your XP gain is determined by the time you spend playing.

- Customization is either ugly, or will lead to you having a disadvantage because you stand out.

- Fun heavily depends on how well your team works together (at least for me). This can make the game incredibly fun, or very frustrating.

- Vaulting is a pain and often doesn't work properly.

- You will frequently get killed by completely random grenade (launcher) and RPG spam.

- Might be hard to get into at first.

(Edit: Almost forgot this:
- There are ""restricted zones"" in which you cannot shoot (so as to prevent spawnkilling probably), but they're very weirdly placed. Spawnkilling is still possible, however flanking can be hard on some maps due to this. As an example, on one map the zone starts immediately behind the building in which the objective is, which means you cannot enter from behind or briefly go outside to kill incoming defenders.)

Now for the good things:

+ Requires teamwork, and most of the community is willing to work together and to aim for the win, rather than the highest K/D rate.

+ Commander/Observer combo is an amazing idea and feels so...strategic.

+ Great gunplay, nice feeling of recoil and big differences between weapons.

+ Weapons have different customization and make them feel even different.

+ Classes have distinct equipment and roles.

+ The two factions feel different.

+ Sound is great, nice directionality of footsteps etc.

+ Maps are quite nice.

Overall it's a great game and I definitely recommend it, but it is far from perfect. Consider all the negative points before buying this game.",1596018887,1598123610,False,1,0,0.525052189826965,0,True,False,False,76561198092072900,122,33,11481,0,5909,1600972389

4931353,552500,Warhammer: Vermintide 2,54498220,english,"vermintide 1 was good but classes were limited. Vermintide 2 expanded each for more diverse play styles.
positives:
-the talent tree and class skills. while the number of weapons is a little bigger then vermintide 1, the skills for each class and advanced class will make sure you find the play style that you like. You may have to grind out classes if you like playing a sword and shield character, but worth it for the perks.
-The flow of the game is perfect, linger too long and elite enemies or a swarm will force you forward. 
-Randomness of spawns. Maps are non changing and except for certain mobs, most encounters on replayed maps have differing enemy numbers and types. The elites that chase you at periods never have a set pattern and can be annoying. The bosses can spawn, have had 3 in a map, or not at all. can create a near impossible to survive situation but that adds fun to the game.
Negatives: 
Few maps and once you learn them, you can predict what is going to happen and prepare for it. wish they had more maps or a map creator so players to make their own and upload them to the workshop. not sure how that would work since maps are unique and don't have repeating, cookie-cutter objects but as a player of rift and dimensions, I would welcome a chance to build my own
No save points; maps are large and while it does make sense for a party that dies to start over on normal and higher, the easy levels where you are learning the game should have a few save points. There are a few maps that i spent 5-6 hours trying to clear 1 map multiple times on EASY before beating it.",1565169643,1565169643,True,1,0,0.479176133871079,0,False,False,False,76561198065162300,95,15,2400,0,1162,1602637869

2751214,253230,A Hat in Time,37987021,english,"Bottom Line Up Front:
A Hat in Time is a solid 3D platformer which for the most part, doesn't make a whole lot of waves in the genre. The platforming is good, offering enough wiggle room to allow you to correct any mistakes you may make (if you act quickly enough) and giving you a real sense of wonder as you explore the worlds offered. By no means is this a pixel perfect, difficult platformer. The game feels much more focused on experiencing the world than on creating a difficult and rewarding experience like some other platformers choose to do. The game progresses less linearly than some other platformers with smaller stories contained within the world rather than one larger story that takes you through the game. The game has a great tone, being fun and lighthearted, with a few darker stories that appeal to the adults who grew up with games like these as kids.

The core gameplay loop:
You primarily play levels on a world where you'll earn a timepiece. Most levels you earn the timepiece by exploring and solving small puzzles or platforming challenges until you reach the end. There are a handful of bossbattles in the game that are all unique and fun. And some levels ask you to complete very specific missions to unlock the timepiece. Once you've gotten the timepiece on that level you can go back for collectibles, but I moved quickly from timepiece to timepiece. As you progress, rifts will open on levels you've already completed and you can go back and get another timepiece by finding the rift and completing the short platforming challenge there. As you progress gathering collectibles you can decorate your ship with a handful of relics, decorate your character with new outfits and hat styles, and outfit past levels with new soundtracks. As you progress you also gather yarns which you'll use to stitch new hats, allowing you to interact more and more with the levels you've already completed to unlock collectibles you weren't able to reach when you first went through. You can also purchase badges which affix to your hats giving your character different abilities or gameplay modifications (grappling hook, ability cooldown reducing, changing your sprint mechanic into your character jumping on a solid gold scooter, giving you only one heart, making all words spoken to your character come out as mumbling are just a few).

The Hats:
This games major gimmick is the inclusion of several different hats which each have different functions. You build these up over the course of the game, but I got most of them fairly quickly and easily. The hats are the root of puzzle solving and world exploration and quickly feel like a natural extension of your character. 

The Set Pieces:
The game offers 4 world setpieces (with two planned in future DLC) which are varied and unique. Each world has its own set of characters (the NPCs in this game are an absolute blast), enemies, and themes. Each world has a series of levels with different objectives which reward a time piece. Along the way to getting your time piece, you'll pick up various collectible yarns which you'll use to create new hats, rift tokens which you'll use to unlock outfits and music tracks, and relics which are trophies you'll take back to your ship and decorate it with. These worlds are varied experiences. 3 of the worlds are contained within one map; all of the levels/missions on these worlds are different objectives within that map. 1 world takes you through a variety of very small, linear maps which focus more on telling the specific stories of that level. In between these worlds you can wander around Hat Girl's space ship which is a colorful collection of rooms and (as the game progresses) NPCs. There are three rifts per world you can go back to find and complete. One of those rifts is always a pink rift which is longer and tells a story about that world. There also seem to be hidden diary pages in the game that you can unlock.

Replayability and value of time spent:
Let's face it. This game costs half the price of a AAA title (without a sale it's $30 at time of this review). I bought it at full price and at the time of review I've gotten 10 hours out of it. In these 10 hours I've beaten the entire story and collected all of the time pieces, but not quite all the collectibles or achievements. If I wanted to get the rest of the achievements and collectibles, It'd probably take me another few hours. That's what you're being offered with the core game. However, the developers have enabled in depth modding support allowing you to download from Steam Workshop community levels, new hats, new outfits and characters. I haven't spent too much time wandering around the workshop but I did see a few high quality mods that offer to extend the in game experience significantly. At the time of this review, no additional DLCs have come out and I don't know what their pricing scheme will be, but they also offer to extend the gameplay by about 50%. If you're a person who wants a lot of hours per dollar spent, this game might not be for you (yet! you can always wishlist it and wait for a good sale or wait until there's a lot of high quality workshop content to experience) but if you're a person who's okay with a game offering 10 or 20 fun hours with something like I am, then it's a good option if you like the premise of the game.

Final Note:
This game is fun for what it is. I'd recommend taking the time and money to experience it if you feel like it meets your personal criteria for how much content a game should offer. If you're looking through a lighthearted romp through a series of unique and colorful worlds with hilarious characters to meet along the way, this is the game for you. It's in my opinion, the best so far of the 3D platforming collectathon spiritual successors.",1512164588,1512164643,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198070614200,666,3,739,0,659,1575821606

Towards to later half of the game the story starts to become extremely exciting and intriguing. All main characters are written authentic and intresting.

--------
I've played a lot of Rimworld, and I'm about to tell you a story.

I messed around with my starting crew, made a character based off of me, and two semi-randomized ones that ended up to be female.

The colony started as normal, but very soon after starting, my character formed a relationship with one of the girls. It went well for a while but she eventually broke up with me, because that's just how life is, man. Soon after, another character joined up; another chick. She imediately starts flirting with me and I keep turning her down. And then things started getting a little whack.

A drop pod landed with a wounded survivor. I check their stats and traits. Another girl. A drug addict. No particularly good skills. .... Also, for some strange reason, already my lover. But also not already joined the colony.

So I send someone out to patch her up. She was in REALLY rough shape, in a coma for almost an entire week. The entire time my character suffering from the ""I want to sleep with my lover"" debuff.

Times were rough.

She then, eventually recovers to full health... but refuses to join the colony. She slowly, very slowly walked off the map, and I never saw her again. But, she forever remained my lover.

I kept playing, and after more and more people joining up, I had 8 or 9 colonists. And every single one other than my character... was female. Constantly they flirted with me, trying to form a relationship, including the girl who dumped me at the start. But my character was very loyal to his lost lover. I would not betray her. I was surrounded by thirsty females and EVERYONE was misserable from being rebuffed time and time again.

And that is how I accidently made an anime harem in Rimworld.",1541992319,1541992319,True,0,2,0,0,True,False,False,76561198042458200,186,5,12891,0,12629,1554217653

The sailing feels good.

Though the official servers are simply collapsing under the pressure.
And the single player breaks as soon as you cross a border, because it thinks your ship is still in previous region, you wont realise the bug until you die and have to respawn. Ship gets removed from company, then you find you way back to a previous region and your ship is there by magic.  Unplayable.

Official server:
Many regions have completely bugged out water near unplayable and the list grows weekly.
Then there are the regions that have seemingly crashed and never let the players log in again, whole tribes nullified from game.

Xbox users get crazy lag just standing on an empty island.
Xbox users run into icebergs that dont render for them, where as they will render for PC users such as myself.
I got 2 friends to buy atlas, they dropped the game immediately because of the instability.

The devs are very quiet and seemingly don't fix reported issues or at least that is the impressions I get from the official forums and discord.

1 thing I can say for certain, a water based game where the water is broken across 50% of the map, is not a very good game at all.
Water activities such as diving shipwrecks are broken with glitched terrain blocking access points to wrecks.
I would like to host my own server but as yet I have not figured out how, its just a joke, hosting a hand crafted server on empyrion galactic survival was the biggest hosting ballache I ever had, but atlas really takes the cake, nothing clear about this.   

It is an ambitious project but the devs have a long long way to go.
There is a huge list of recurring bugs/issues and crashes in this game, the community talks about it every day, the devs never say a word or aknowledge issues.

Changing my Recommend to No for this game, the PvP is a disaster but I blame the PvP community for that, creating an unrealistic game meta that gives no sense to the era we are playing in here. 

The game has separate server for pvp and pve which is probably the worst thing, as Some players like to just sail and explore and are not hellbent on killing every player that moves and would like to rp a bit of combat to relive that pirates of the caribbean feeling, cant do that on PvP servers here because its just a million people trying to kill anything and everything and giving grief in chat at the same time.  A server that allowed combat only by agreement with a player or tribe would work better, A battle manager tool that could organise duels or battles of any kind in PvE would be a key feature of success on this game.
Allowing combat to take place in PvE between consenting parties.

Dont mind the overal ""Mostly Negative"" reviews because they are mostly when the game was in 1.0-ish. Now the devs have made it into 4.0 and the bugs is not to befound and perforamance is good (see speccs below)

2016-06-27:  
With 6 hours into the main story there seems to be tons to do and the space feels endless with many paths to pick. The atmosphere is tick and just slowly fly past a forest/farm on a large space ship is a great audiovisuall experience :). 
The ship control feels right with the mouse/keyboard as well as the handcontroller and the game runs great on a ""old"" 680 with the resolution 1920x1200. I would recommend a SSD for this game because of the small load times will not be felt such as when an old HDD is used.   


2016-07-28:
20 hours in and the game is becoming better and better. Amazing momement to send the troops to another ship and actually see the swarm of small ships land on the other ship while the rest of the crew is nuking it with laser...

2016-08-11: 
Im at work thinking about how to make the big buck with a new trading strategy that Ive slept on. The game is getting more fun, complex and better looking for each hour... 2016 GOTY for me.

2016-12-19: 
New graphic card (690) and the SLI support is not good at all, you can force SLI by having it set to ALT 2. Works quite ok. But Ive finally having some spare time to roam around. Making my first space station and its really fun to see it built in real time.
Also the the game will get another update with a new X-rebirt in...VR! The devs way to care for their games should be the golden standard for game devs :).

2017-08-06
70 hours and I finally completed the game storyline, built a base with 6/10 parts done and I can say that this game has opend my eyes for space sims.

The base game has a full 80-100 hours of content if you're willing to sit down and look through every nook and cranny in this game. On sale, you can get this amount of game for only $12! It's an actual steal! The graphics are amazing, still holds up as one of the most beautiful games in 2019. It's also incredibly well optimized, even people on average computers can enjoy the beauty of this game. 

Both of the DLC's for this game together add another 80-120 hours on content. You can get the Game of the Year Edition for $15 on sale!!! That includes base game AND all the DLC!!! A game worth 300-400 hours of content for only $15? That's not a steal, that's grand theft! Incredible DLC, both of them. Hearts of Stone is an expansive story to the game, add more interesting characters and paths. Blood and Wine adds a whole new map to the game, in which is the most beautiful expansion to a map I've ever seen. The story to Blood and Wine is like a whole 'nother game on its own, its incredibly well done.

CD Projekt Red didn't only knock it out the park with this one, they sent the ball to space. It's a worthy purchase, its a game I'd say every PC on earth should have, along with Garry's Mod. I'd say, buy this game when its not on sale, support the developers. THIS is how an open world RPG should be done, and it's now a game I use the gauge other RPG's. There's a reason this game gets so much positive reviews. Don't sit and wonder if you should buy, just buy it.

Many others explained what the game is, so I won't bother with details, but I will say what I feel about it. It is one of those games where you keep saying five more minutes and end up having played 6 hours. The addictive element in it is that it preys on your completion desires. You want to build a mining machine, aka miner, that harvests iron ore for you, for which you’ll need coal, which you can harvest by another miner, and transport on conveyer belts that will then feed into both machines. How do you get that into the miners? Well you’ll have inserters that will feed the miners, but these miners need energy themselves. Why Yes! That would be coal, inserted into them by other inserters, that in turn need coal for energy. That’s just the first 5 minutes, or the very first 15 as you are still discovering the game.

That being said, this game has some significant issues. For one, there are some pretty annoying bugs that you can encounter especially when starting up the game. There are also some dubious balancing choices, for example: High attack speed weapons (Rapier, Cleaver, Dagger, etc.) are far too effective because of how difficult they are to block and because of how they can block literally anything you throw at them, even stuff like Battleaxes and Broadswords. Specific weapons such as the Executioner's Sword are also a bit unbalanced (it really needs to cost more to equip). Not to mention the fact that most of the Frontline maps blatantly lean to one side (of course the real meat of the game comes from Deathmatch but that's besides the point). Ranged weapons and cavalry can also be annoying, but I wouldn't consider them broken. Finally, I've heard a lot of talk about dubious cheat protections that has a tendency to ban innocent people more then actual cheaters.

Nothing excuses the devs leaving this game, people were expecting them to support this game for more than a year.

458522,292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,16435868,english,"This game is nothing short of fantastic.

The world, characters, and dialogue create a truly immersive experience. Nearly all quests feel unique, as if each one is telling a different story. And yet, so many of the quests manage to connect and influence the overall narrative. I spent over 100 hours in my first playthrough, and immediately began another so I could see what happens when different decisions are made.

For the amount of content, the number of bugs in this game is surprisingly low, and I've yet to encounter one that is critical in nature (i.e. preventing me from proceeding with the story).

My only gripe with this game is that the skill tree felt very underwhelming. I felt locked into a small subset of all of the skills available to me, and at times didn't even bother spending my skill points since you cannot use all of the skills you learn simultaneously anyway. There are significant portions of the skill tree that I never explored with my first playthrough - and I don't really feel encouraged to in my next playthrough either.

Fortunately, the skills are but a fraction of the content available in this game, and with all things considered, don't detract from the gameplay experience.

I only have a little more than 100 hours on this game but I've been consistently watching streams of it since it came out and have kept up with it since longgg before I finally picked up my own PC. It used to be pretty balanced, with balance patches here and there mixing up the meta. 

Now, this 1v4, intentionally imbalanced, ""survive against all odds"", horror game has become a 1v4 ""try and get a kill against all odds"", surprisingly balanced for a 1v4, bully-the-killer game.

Over the last few months, patches keep coming out that directly address complaints of survivor mains, then either ignore, barely touch on, or outright claim it's not a problem whenever killer mains have any complaints of things in game that had really ought to be changed. This has resulted in the survivors being able to negate things the killers do that take a lot of effort (outplaying a survivor to get two hits on him, hooking someone, etc.)  by just standing in the right spot, equipping one perk forever, or doing one skill check.

Despite the survivors becoming more and more unnecessarily powerful, and the people who play mostly killer continuously and loudly voicing their concerns, the developers release patch after patch after patch and have developer live streams where they announce that they will not be working on things the killers would like changed at any point in the near future, but have many plans to tend to the wishes of the survivors. I used to be a killer main and this was my most played game. Now I sometimes get back on to play survivor, but I've moved onto other games. It's a crying shame. Do not buy this until the devs make an effort to fix it, which, if the last handful of awful patches are any indication, won't be any time soon.

EDIT 1: I definitely purchased this game at full price, I'm not sure why it says I got this for free...

EDIT 2: I've more than doubled my hours since this review, and I can say now that the game is in a better place than it was at the time of the above review. The developer (BHVR) has purchased the full rights of their game from their publisher (can't remember the name), and it has been only great stuff since then. There's been way more communication, way more use of the play test server for big changes, and way more ACTUALLY listening to the community. I'm far happier now with the game than I was before, and I'm happy to change my review to positive.

Obligated to say maybe this more positive experience is because I'm now a survivor main...  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯",1510017893,1532405753,True,0,0,0.546020448207855,0,True,True,False,76561198406861700,59,3,82585,680,19531,1610686656

Basically you have to build houses to grow your village. But as it grows, you have to be careful with the amount of children:
- Too many new houses at once: too many new children will be born, the adults may not be able to provide enough food and firewood, resulting in starvation/freezing.
- Too little new houses built: your people may become old and die before they have children, reducing your population.

Once you realize how the game works, you will spend lots of time in the beginning of each game trying to figure out where to put each building to take advantage of the map.

Story and characters are great.  Dialogues and speech acting is superb.  Graphics are awesome.  The side quests are usually as exciting and adventurous as the main story's quests.  Gwent is one of the best mini-games I've played and I've spent countless hours just playing other players with this card game.  Many ways to play this game, full combat, full sign (mage), full alchemist or a combo of any.  My first run was a combo of combat and sign, mostly sign.  Second time around I'm going to try either a full sign or sign/alchemy.  Did I say this game is huge?  It is.  Just when you think you're getting close to the end, it grips you in for a longer journey.  At no point did I feel the story was too bloated and long.  It's very detailed.  Most of the side quests are very interesting and the choices you make in the game do make a difference in how the story ends.

2054166,381210,Dead by Daylight,37494001,english,"Ja, das gute Dead by Daylight. Oder sollte ich sagen Dead by Buglight? Bzw. Dead by Loadingscreen? Das Spiel hat seine Macken. Teilweise sind Bugs bis heute nicht gefixt,oder es werden einfach Killer zu Tode generft, wie z.B. der Legion. Die Nurse wurde letztens auch generft und sie macht seitdem kein Spaß mehr.
Es kann lustige Momente geben,oder eben “ oft “ Momente in denen man die DbD Logik nicht versteht. Ein Beispiel: Die Hitbox ist auch so eine recht negative Sache, die mal korrigiert werden sollte. Teils wird man noch getroffen, obwohl man schon 5m weiter steht.

An sich macht das Spiel schon Spaß! Mit Freunden noch mehr. Durch die Erneuerung mit dem Archiv,hat man jetzt Aufgaben die belohnt werden, wenn man sie erfüllt. Ich finde dies ist eine gute Sache,weil es das Spiel noch mehr fesselt,was es ohne hin schon tut. (sehe Stunden)! Frustration ist allerdings vorprogrammiert, ebenso wie die Toxische-Community. Wenn man sich zu sehr aufregt, sei es durch die Killer,oder Survivor. Weil aus der Survivor Sicht die Mitspieler z.B. Null Teamwork kennen,oder sonst wie dumm anstellen. Dann sollte man lieber eine Pause machen und später wieder Spielen, oder einfach besser mit Freunden spielen, was meiner Meinung nach  ohnehin mehr Spaß macht und man kann sich absprechen. 

Was ich allerdings nicht verstehe (mal aus der Sicht des Killers), sind die teabaggenden Survivor beim Ausgang. Die denken immer, sie wären total lustig und gut spielend, wenn sie am Ausgang stehen und 1m vor der sicheren Flucht sind. Wenn ihr rausgehen könnt, dann macht es bitte. Aber gammelt nicht Ewigkeiten vor dem Ausgang nur, um zu warten bis irgendwann der Killer kommt um ihn dann zu teabaggen! Ekelhaftes Verhalten!!!

The setting is small but doesn't make a lot of sense. In fact, I feel this is a knock off of the idea of  the game Damned, except the maps do not change. 
- The graphics are nice but nothing special considering the small size.
- The controls are easy to pick up......extremely simple.
- The sounds are set.
- The characters look is decent.

However the following is all that needs to be fixed/currently broken which is what you are buying now regardless of its current stage.
- The killer's wipe down of the blade after each attack is not only annoying but retarded in the sense that...why? Since it takes multiple hits to hurt someone critically, you are forced to go half speed while wiping down the blade before you are allowed to return to normal speed. It shows lack of creativity/design. 
- Control movements when interacting with the environment(pushing down the numerous crates and barriers) is non fluent and all movements similiar to this are the same. There is no chance for this fail, different style of it, etc.
- Takes you 2 seconds to stick someone up on the spike but takes the people half of a second to get them down regardless of how long they are up on the stick. This again seems to be a lack of creativity not to mention really bad design. Being stabbed multiple times and they are able to get away at half speed. 
- The crashing of this game is about 3/5 chances as the killer. This means the game is over and 0 xp. Way to high!
- No XP for playing with friends.

Episode 2 adds a pair of nasty enemies (the hunter and strider) that are much harder than anything encountered in the earlier chapters of HL2. Veterans will enjoy the added challenge. The gravity gun is as satisfying to use as ever and the vehicle sequences are more varied than the endless driving stages in the original HL2.

It going without saying that Episode 3 ending would have been a good end to the series but yet still would be the ending we all wanted. 

Valve isn't like that...

What they normally do is raise the bar, make a greater and a better ending what is expected, such as with the portal series. it was thought to be a side feature but it turned out to be better than the others...


There is also a lot of evidence that Marc Laidlaw writing won't be the last in the HL series. there are thing pointing to a VR HL title in the works at Valve. that and many 'leaks'

I for one is annoyed that they couldn't finish the series sooner. but for me, there is still an ever shrinking rift of Half life 3 being released but is still just a hope.

It's just my point of view.

Overall it's super solid, the story is somewhat engaging but I have to say I really prefer the Doom 2016 vibes, the animations felt waaaaaaay more curated and alive, the demons and graphics were way more fearsome and overall I think it's a more polished game EXCEPT from the gameplay mechanics. In this Eternal completely beats 2016.

Goods:
-Super good game mechanics
-Greater mobility than 2016
-Hell lot of new demons and finishers to them
-Skins for everything!
-Good story.
-Graphics (I still prefer Doom's 2016, even knowing they wanted to be more faithful to the old doom demons... But they ARE good)
-Rip
-Tear

Improvable:
-Codex entries... God I love the story but I would rather have had a bit more of it explained over voice notes or cutscenes I don't know
-SnapMap. I think Eternal could highly benefit from it, and I'm not a huge fan of battlemode personally
-Battlemode is meh at best

Whole campaign with all unlockables upgrades, etc... took me around 30 hours in Hurt me plenty. So more or less same as 2016, a bit more I would say even. It takes a bit to get used to the gameplay mechanics,  but I think after mission 3 the game just turns waaaaay better for some reason in case you feel the game is not clicking the first 2 missions.

1. Plays more like a strategic board game where you should be planning your moves in advance along with some backup exit/retaliation strategies.
2. Positional play, such as in poker, is very valuable.
3. Comeback potential huge. I know everyone says the red deck is OP but the game is not as straightforward as that. The right combination of cards can neuter a red deck by the second round.
4. I love dota lore, voice actors and interactions between cards are high quality.
5. Pretty good emphasis on social play / playing among friends. We're really into discussing what cards we have / strats related to it right now.
6. Lastly, teaches you accountability because now you have no one but yourself to blame for your shitty decision making, a self-reflective skill sorely missing in most people.

To address the monetization:
-Packs cost 2.50 CAD, game costs 26.99 CAD and you receive 10 packs with that initial cost. You are effectively paying 1.99 CAD for access to the game.
-Have you ever played a TCG with that one friend who decides to unload thousands of dollars on ultra rare cards and sets that you have no hope of playing against with your $50 deck? Yeah well let's see them try to unload thousands of dollars now, when you can build effective decks for pennies. Literally, pennies. Like, walk around and pick up a few coins off the sidewalk amount of pennies.
-Are you worried that not having access to every single card puts you at an unfair disadvantage to your opponent?

Remember the Alpha? All those neat skill trees and features? Yeah, no, let's get rid of all that.

Every time you change region (A small chunk of land on the map), any equipment you gained from the previous region is basically useless in any other region besides the region you got he equipment in the first place. This is also true for travel equipment such as boats, gliders etc...

What does this mean?

Well what it means is that every time you change region, you have to grind as if you started a new game (except few exceptions such as artifacts, which give near useless buffs such as ""+3% sail speed"") to be able to properley explore the new region.
There is equipment known as ""equipment+"", which can be used in the region it was found and some of the surrounding regions, but those bits of equipment are rare as hell most of the time, and by the time you get one to drop, it will probably not even be usable for your class.

This means that if you are bored of the current region for what ever reason, such as the fact that a large chunk of each region is just empty randomly generated space, then you have to think hard on whether or not you want to lose all your progress and move to another region, or try your best to enjoy the region you are currently in.

This release is just a mere shadow of what the alpha was and could have been (with relation to the numerous pictures and chunks of information wollay uploaded on twitter and the actual alpha build).

I didn't even talk about how almost anything can near instant kill you when you start each region, while you do crap damage.

TL;DR

No real sense of progress because your equipment resets to starter equipment the moment you leave your current region.

At the end of the day you get a game with a solid core loop, fun combat, a bad story, and exhaustingly reused assets. Personally I still think it's a fun game but when compared to how polished and how much money goes into other AAA games at the same price tag I find its entry fee is simply too high for what you're getting.

I'm left with a feeling similar to when your lunch is just a bit too expensive. Service was alright, the meal was nothing to complain about, but paying $30 for lunch just doesn't sit right somehow.

[h1][b]In Depth Review[/b][/h1]
The game is fun and I find myself hooked on it. Somehow and for some reason I find myself overlooking it's many flaws and I'm just having a great time smashing monsters to pieces with my huge anime rocket hammer. This is a grind game. You will fight the same enemies over and over. If that doesn't appeal to you then this game isn't for you straight up.

People seem to get mad when this game is compared to Monster Hunter but it makes sense to compare the most popular Monster Hunting genre game (of which the term originated) for people to grasp the differences.

Combat in God Eater is much, much faster and I find less punishing. Weapons you can pick up and really learn in likely an hour. You unlock various perks that can customize parts of the attack combos to your liking. Even the slowest weapons in this game will feel fast compared to most things in Monster Hunter. 

Combat is also less technical, while there is still break points and weak points depending on your weapon type (slash, pierce, crush) combat doesn't necessarily hinge on lining up that one single good blow that if you miss you're screwed on. However, this title does seem to lack the incredibly satisfying feedback that you get in MHW when you're totally just wailing on a weakpoint kicking the crap out of a monster.

Further, I find the short mission times (about 4 - 5 mins where I'm at now) refreshing. As someone with a job and responsibilities it's nice to be able to jump into a few missions a night instead of looking down the barrel of those 25 - 30 minute slogs you find in MHW. This feels like I game I can actually complete within a reasonable timeframe.

For more differences: mission prep is basically non-existent, and many of the meta systems like in Monster Hunter World are not present - such as eating, the palico caravan, the material farming garden thing, etc. For some this is bad, for me I don't really miss having to deal with a bunch of random chores when I get back from a mission.

For the bad however - this game is simply a much more budget title than MHW yet is priced the same. I would not be surprised if the budget for GE3 was 1/10th of what MHW's was yet it somehow masquarades itself as a full priced title. The quality is more in line with a mid-tier title like Senran Kagura and to me should be priced around 30 - 40 dollars.

The maps in GE3 are all arenas. They're all super small and there aren't that many of them. They are reused CONSTANTLY and is probably my biggest gripe of the game. This means there is none of the free roam exploration present in MHW and even compared to old Mon Hun titles the maps are absolutely tiny. I wager it took less people less time to make every single map in this entire game than it did a single zone in MHW.

The story is frankly kind of bad in my opinion and leaves me with many questions about the world - mainly how the AGEs are even imprisoned. It's said that a single small Ash Aragami could wipe out an entire battalion of humans yet you kill multiple Large Ash Aragami so why, exactly, are the AGEs letting people imprison and control them? Why not just wholesale slaughter everyone who is in your way? Why follow the laws? I'm sure there's deep lore in some manga somewhere that explains everything but IMO you get a cliche, somewhat preposterous shonen story. I'm not very much into it myself and this is coming from someone who is a massive weeb.

So at the end of the day you get a game with a solid core loop, fun combat, a bad story, and exhaustingly reused assets. Personally I still think it's a fun game but when compared to how polished and how much money goes into other AAA games at the same price tag I find it's entry fee is simply too high for what you're getting.",1550968269,1550968920,True,1,0,0.505747139453888,0,False,False,False,76561197970733700,841,33,4451,0,2823,1574213083

2625852,242920,Banished,64252346,english,"I have played this game over 300 hours trying to decide if I would recommend it or not. Obviously, that means there are many attractive features to the game (also, I was ill and couldn't do anything but play games for awhile...).  I binged, then I moved on to something else, then I came back to give it another a chance, and here's my review:

First, on the purely technical level, the game is a mess, and a lazy mess at that. Who launches a game to a black screen with no indicators that it's loading? And the game takes a LONG time to load, even in vanilla. With a bunch of mods, especially Megamod8, it is interminable. And that's just to get to the screen that lets you start a new game or load an old one. 

If you use Megamod8- which is the easy way for people who don't have a deep knowledge of Banished's peculiarities get a bunch of extra content to make the game more interesting- DO NOT play on an Extra Large Map, unless you are playing on a Cray. I have a new Ryzen7/RTX2060 system, and I finally bailed out of the preparation screen (which at least shows you a pretty picture and updates a fantasy list of things the program is 'doing' (suppressing goblins, forsooth) to let you know it's working. Ironically, or appropriately, your cursor changes into an hourglass for this...)  after twenty minutes. Of course,  this leads to another black screen, but this one never processes through, as far as I can tell, and ctrl-alt-delete just initiates a war between task manager and the black screen which ultimately requires restarting the computer.

From this, you get an idea of the fundamental issues in the game- the tech end is very primitive and restrictive for the kind of game it tries to be, and the developer having abandoned it, many people have tried to fix or extend various aspects, which lead to a host of new problems.

For me, the vanilla game is just not that interesting. It's challenging at first, but too limited- it's the beginning of a good game (though with lots of flaws), that was never completed by the developer. The attempts of the modding community to complete it for him are a glorious example of community support, and some excellent work has been done, but ultimately they all collide with various problems and limitations of the game engine that modders have no ability to touch. The result is a real clusterf*ck. 

Another serious issue is documentation. Because of the limitations of the original game, people WILL use mods, but very few of the mods have decent documentation, if any. Thus it takes a lot of hours to figure out what does or does not work together, and even within Megamod8, which is a compilation of mods by people who know what they are doing, there are sometimes conflicts that don't become apparent until you use an item in mid game and you get a fatal crash. Even elements that play nice together often have supply-chain requirements in-game that depend on completely different sets of ingredients despite apparently doing the same thing. Figuring out which building creates the special resources for a building you've already built can be tedious, requiring you basically go into debug mode and build building for free until you find the one with the right production elements.

I had a great desire to like this game, as many people apparently do to judge by the work they have put into it. As much as I applaud their efforts, though, I think this attachment is futile and the equivalent of Stockholm Syndrome.",1582908388,1582908388,False,1,0,0.437176167964935,0,False,False,False,76561199019995500,35,6,22268,0,18939,1603164539

It's is a very good deal underwhelming when compared to what mods can give you, but it does the job decently for what it is. I just hope for non-ost song support soon. I'm still not a fan of the new UI. I'm a very big tryhard, so I don't appreciate feeling like I'm loading up a just dance-esque party game when in reality, I'm about to sweat my ass off playing maps that my eyes are unable to properly comprehend. I honestly won't use the stock multiplayer, especially once support for the multiplayer mod comes out, and the UI is pretty bad too, so the update was a net negative for me.

3109316,583950,Artifact,47432498,english,"As a disclaimer, I haven't played much constructed, so this is more pertinent to draft than constructed. 

This is by far the best draft digital card game i've played. Sure there are some heroes that are better than others, but in draft, the odds of getting those heroes are very unlikely. In general you will have to work with the mediocre heroes and a lot of the times, the default heroes for each color. The game itself in draft mode goes fairly long (often mana turn 10-13), and usually games are very close. Often times games you lose is because of a mistake you've made, and this game has a very high skill ceiling (unlike hearthstone, where the optimal play is fairly easy to read). The frequency of nail-biter game in draft mode is so high that winning a game in phantom draft (casual and free) are often by itself gives you such a triumph feeling that cannot be obtained anywhere else. 

Monetization wise, I found that the game is pretty fair. If you've played magic or yugioh in real life, this is what it entails to. If you want to get into the game, you have to pay to play. Realistically, this game (even for constructed) is far cheaper than hearthstone unless you are willing to committ hundreds of hours each month.  Given that there is a trade market (which I really appreciate), you cannot get free packs, or the packs won't retain any value. This is as realistic as an actual TCG in terms of existence of a market. 

In terms of progression and reward, why do we need reward to play? If you don't derive enjoyment in playing the game itself, you shouldn't be playing this game. Playing for reward is how freemium games these days try to get you hooked, but it doesn't mean you actually have fun playing the game. 

On top of all, you have free draft mode to play. Hearthstone doesn't have that, what more can you ask for? People complaining about the lopsided constructed mode should really give draft mode a shot.

- you open a group lobby
- you invite a friend or 2
- everyone clicks ready and you wait 7 seconds
- then you wait some more
- 2/3 of the time you will get ""no session found"" and everybody has to ""ready up"" AGAIN
- next round .... or maybe roundS .... oh and btw... while teh game searches, everyone can ""unready"" by clicking ""ready that becomes available while searching (false lable on that oen might get fixt ""soon"")
- you finaly enter a real game lobby
- killer aka host might be lagging; killer aka might dodge ... problems as ever ... if you somehow not start teh game it all starts all over again
- everyone has to ready up again
- you start the game!!! (it has been a minutes long clickfest but you finaly made it!!!)
- you play the game and after 15 min at the most the game ends
- everyone has to leave the after game lobby and gets put into the pre-solo quee lobby
- you leave that lobby
- you start a grouped lobby again ... and all from the start ...

Just as many games of yesteryear the controls are very difficult. I think I struggled more with the controls than the actual enemies. I got through  70% of the game until I gave up and activated God mode. You'll want to save before every long jump too as platforming is hard.

For some reason, recently, I was unable to actually play the game and was stuck in spectator mode, flying freely around the map. Then, a minute ago, I open the game and notice that it works just fine. So I'm going to assume that it will continue to switch to spectator mode every so often and revert back to normal, although this hasn't been a problem till recently. When the game works, it is quite fun. 

I always have a sense of unease while playing PvP, for fear not of monsters, but of players. 
Probably because most of them are hackers who have a ""Shoot-on-site"" mindset and will not hesitate to one shot you if they see you. 

PvE is a much different experience, since it adds an element of cooperation between players, but also makes the game much easier since the Nethers aren't too difficult to evade. PvE also removes the threat of hackers, since they cannot harm you in PvE.

If you want a challenging PvP survival experience that comes with hackers (free of charge!) then I certanly recommend this game. If you are looking for a cooperative, PvE survival experience with little challenge (if you know what you're doing), I also recommend this game. But be warned, hackers are an issue in PvP, and the development team seems to have dropped off the planet, so it's unlikely this will be fixed soon, if ever.

Overall: The development team should be more active, and should be more diligent with anti-cheat. But it looks unlikely they will be back soon, if ever.

For what it is in its current (and probably permanant) state, I like the game a lot, despite it's flaws.

You can contract yourself out to other shipping companies or start your own, buy a fleet of trucks, manage a roster of drivers, and build an empire. The game's ambition scales with yours and you can play as seriously or casually as you wish. Unlike most simulators where you can experiment without consequence, ETS2 makes you want to excel at every task and get through every trip without damaging your equipment or disappointing your customer.

Driving takes a lot of concentration and awareness but is ultimately relaxing. The scenery is beautiful even if it doesn't render cities anything like their real-world geographies. Being able to tune in to local European internet streaming radio stations adds a lot of flavour, making you feel you're right there as you listen to DJ chatter in French or German or Polish while playing local favourites.

Vehicles control well enough on an Xbox gamepad but I've watched people on Twitch with steering wheels and head trackers play the game in all its glory. Mouse and keyboard are viable as well and are superior to the gamepad when it comes to looking around, but it's more precise driving with an analog controller of some sort.

It makes stories for you, you just need to give the game direction. You can be anything (with the exception of a couple things that I will cover later in the review). It's brutal, but every story needs its conflict in order to be entertaining. You can feel truly powerless, as you are weaker than the majority of the characters in the game, creating a merciless environment for you to become immersed in.  There are times of triumph, and times of misery.

The game is great, but there are a few annoyances within it.

1. Slave AI can be super duper janky, making a playthrough as a ""slave liberator"" very difficult to actually play out. It seems that they forget that they are being freed, making it much less satisfying to actually free slaves.
2. You cannot actually join a faction, whether it be the United Cities or the Holy Nation. I wish you could conscript into one of the nation's armies.
3. Minor bugs, mainly with pathfinding (thankfully just loading the previous autosave will fix most issues)

PROS:
- very wide and open World, with many places to explore
- great variety of enemies to face and you won't win just by smashing the hit button. You'll need tactics for each foe
- many quests have different paths and endings, some of which cause impact in subsequent quests
- some of the NPC characters have a good depth 
- tons of well made cutscenes that give ultra-immersion to your character
- you can experiment playing with a different character throughout the game
- the Gwent card game is a very clever and interesting game inside the main game and adds a lot to the immersion
- the alchemy system is excellent, with tons of different recipes
- the crafting system is innovative, with the possibility of dismantling objects to get materials to make other objects
- you have a useful interaction with your horse, though some mods improve it further
- outstanding graphics and sounds (I specially appreciate the medieval style music)
- Full graphics quality with a medium type computer rig


CONS:
- it's an easy game, even in the higher difficulty level
- the prices are too low, so you can get awesome equipment too early in the game
- you often see the same face in the NPCs - not bad though, if the tradeoff was to have more time for better things


NOTE ABOUT MODS:
- a few mods (notably SotR, btw) increase the combat difficulty and change some of the game mechanics above for the better (prices, horse, alchemy, crafting, etc), increasing even more my interest in the game.",1450129830,1450129830,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198042254600,70,7,41533,0,5273,1486838929

3455862,206440,To the Moon,19797861,english,"What a beautiful story. It's really something compared to the ever-expanding amount of visual novels and story-focused games. The limitations of this game's engine hurt this game in a lot of ways, such as not always seeing exact expression on characters faces, the cheesy animations, and the predictability of some actions the moment as soon as text box comes up. Of course, the game is also riddled with very interesting visual effects and a great score to set the scene for some really touching moments. One time I cried, and I wasn't even close to finishing the game.

On occasions the game gets tedious as you dowse the entirety of the map for the next object to take you to the next area. This is where the immersion breaks (aside from a lot of cheesy, comic relief dialogue), which is a real shame, since many of the characters and areas feel very believable. I often got stuck in areas for these reasons, and I reccomend you keep the internet with you when you're playing through this game.

However, I'm nitpicking. I don't believe you can hate this game, and the DLC minisodes are even better in terms of presentation and writing. It is a really nice story that everybody knows and loves, and if you're missing out, you should join the bandwagon. Maybe it's not a perfect storytelling experience, but it's certainly something made with a lot of love that will undoubtedly, make you cry, too.",1450594340,1450594340,True,1,0,0.523809552192688,0,False,False,False,76561198025627500,145,17,336,0,328,1456593272

   As soon as you open your free packs you cannot refund the game. These are the only free cards you get otherwise you have to use actual money to buy more. There is literally zero other ways to get cards despite the game already being $20. This game is nothing but a cash grab from Valve and its sickening. I've been a fan for over a decade but it seems even the best companies fall to this era of microtransactions and shady tactics. 

   The biggest thing is it is a fun game, its unique and different. Its comprised of three lanes complete with random movements, a shop to buy items in, constant effects in lanes, quick spells, and so much more. The game looks fantastic as well, its polished with a bunch of fun animations and voice lines. The board and outer sceanery as a whole envlopes you into the game and makes you not want to put it down. 
 
   All of this effort is wasted however due to the aforementioned issues and lack of refund due to their ""policy"". The only place this policy is shown, atleast from what Ive seen, is within the games store page under system requirements. Tucked away in small grey font So they can state its clearly stated when its so easily overlooked I thought it to be part of the copyright text under every game.

It is a Metroidvania game, and like all games in the genre, it fetures tight controls, exploration, upgrades that allow you to progress where you couldn't before, and challenging but fair combat. The game is also filled with enough lore/atmosphere/mood to be called 2D Dark Souls-ish. What really makes the game stand out is the excellent and unique art design, visuals, and sound track. The world of Hallownest is hauntingly beautiful, filled with inhabitants that are relatable and memorable, endearing even, like the onion kight in the DS series. Even the monsters you encounter are alluring in their own way, often making me wonder what they would be like and how they would live their lives before the fall of Hallownest. 

A game similar to Hollow Knight would be the excellent Salt and Sanctuary. Yet there is no denying that Hollow Knight is more smoother and polished. The combat is less deep than S&S or DS, but I believe it allows the player to focus on other things, such as exploration, lore, and the artwork, which in some ways remind me of the 2009 film Coraline.

The music fits perfectly into this world, made by heart with its mix of synths, a piano and percussion.
It gives you the right emotions to the right time.

Even though the games artstyle is pixel-based, the game felt very alive & detailed.
Every animation is fluent and nice to look at.

The character design was pretty good, it felt like everyone was kinda developing over time.

3202812,1056960,Wolfenstein: Youngblood,54562147,english,"Short version:
Good: movement, combat, graphics, weapons, foes.
Bad: no pause, no save, annoying AI buddy if offline, boring open-world concept.

There are some VERY valid criticisms about this game, but I am enjoying it. The way I would describe it is: All the really important (and hard) things are done right, and they messed up on the easy stuff. Some of this may get improved/fixed in future patches as I know I'm not the only one frustrated by some of these things.

So first the good:
The character movement, and combat in this game is fantastic. That is the #1 reason I buy Id Software games, and in that area, I am not disappointed.  The weapons are good and the bad guys are fun. The graphics are amazing. I think they implemented fire (flame throwers, explosions, etc.) better than I've seen before.  Bottom line, if the primary reason you buy games is for good solid combat, this game you will like. I can’t comment on the co-op because I play games like this single-player only.

Now the bad:
The game is sort-of open world. I think that is a negative in this type of game. I would rather a game like this be “on the rails” because it would be less repetitive (going through the same levels with different missions) and it would not allow you to end up in places you probably shouldn’t go where there are high level bad guys that are just too hard for your current level/build. Also, I think the overall story suffers from this aspect.

Next is the forced co-op. I am fine with an AI helper, but I dislike that if she is stunned, I have to help or die. I would rather just let her die and keep playing. Especially since she puts herself in harms way and doesn’t use cover well (or at all sometimes). This adds frustration and takes away from the fun. Playing offline should allow pausing the game and saving the game. Both of those have been omitted as well. I have had to walk way only to come back and find my mission failed.

Non-Issue:
I did not mention microtransactions and here is why: They don’t matter and anyone mad about them is just being petty. I didn’t even figure out it had microtransactions for a long time. They ONLY affect cosmetic things like skins, and in almost all cases you can use currency you find in the game instead. I think there is only one skin per skinnable thing that can only be bought with real money. The game does not promote it either, you have to find it in the customization menu. I can’t believe the big deal some people are making over this.",1565506048,1565506048,True,90,18,0.592729151248932,12,True,False,False,76561197970557300,430,8,1697,0,605,1567928000

There is probably not much to be said about TW3 that hasn't already been said at this point, but I wanted to add that it's still, and probably will be for a long time, worth playing even if you've no idea about its lore or the previous games. 

The story is probably the main selling point for the game, it's very fleshed out and the characters well written. The world also helps bring it to life with myriads of side quests and stories that don't feel repetitive or templated. The gameplay feels fluid and satisfying, especially in higher difficulty levels. The graphics are beautiful, and even when they become dated, you'll still occasionally find yourself just admiring the view from a high place.

Overall I would recommend this game to anyone wanting an enjoyable RPG experience, without grinding or tactic-heavy combat, just to sit back and have fun in a vast and adventure-filled world.",1581266815,1581266815,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198005785700,45,5,5988,0,5707,1582134443

2373505,264710,Subnautica,45290808,english,"Pro's:
-Great mechanics, gameplay, and (usually) graphics and open world.
-Survival mechanics are well thought out, and the story has been well flushed out.
-UI is clean, yet minimalist, making the HUD nonintrusive so you can appreciate the beautiful, alien landscape of the Planet you (Not-Really-Spoilers) crash land on in the start of the game.
-Suprisingly deep storyline, with quite an emotional undertone that can make you feel abject fear and despair, as well as elation and even a deep sorrow.
-Includes surprisingly advanced base-building mechanics, making each base you build (and even most submarines) deeply unique.
-Audio Quality and Music is very well done.

Cons:
-(Not really a Con but a PSA) for those who are agoraphobic or hate the deep ocean, UNDERSTAND THIS GAME WILL FREAK YOU OUT AND MAKE YOUR NIGHTMARES THAT MUCH MORE TERRIFYING. The ocean is filled with deadly super-predators that look like half-breeds of Xenomorphs and the beasts of the 40K Warp, each uniquely and utterly terrifying in their own particular ways. Not only are these beasts terrifying to run into in open ocean (which has a haze liek the real ocean, making visual sighting of immenant death rather difficult past 30 meters) or in the dark, but each has its own unique binary set of Roars, which are
      -Roaming around, which is all echo-ey and has a range of WAY TOO FAR, making it difficult to tell how far away your impending doom is or even what direction its coming from
      -Right in your face, which will ALWAYS sound like its in the room behind the monitor about to defecate on your hopes and dreams no matter what volume you are at.
Combine these factors with the lack of ANY way to defend yourself (the only weapon you have is a semi-rusty butterknife and your own gumption) and the other more frightening fact that rears its ugly head very early on that you are more than likely slower than the thing chasing you most of the time, making you little more than a human Happy Meal. Ending this little PSA, I just want to say most other Horror games, even in their prime, can't compare to some sections of Subnautica... so Purchase wisely.
-Can have rendering issues, since the world seems to load into view range in blocks, although this issue isnt as prevalent due to the water's haze effects.
-Progression can be a bit difficult if you dont consult the wiki, since the most the game gives you to look for certain neccesary components for your needed device, doohickey, building, or sub is a costly scanner room with a very limited range that requires near-end-game materials to sync to your HUD. My advice? This is one of those games you'll need your smartphone ready for.
-Glitches and crashes are uncommon, but have repeated themselves enough with me that I thought it relevant.

Conclusion:
Great game, but YOU HAVE TO KNOW BEFORE PLAYING THIS GAME REQUIRES NERVES OF STEEL BECAUSE ITS ESSENTIALLY 50% HORROR GAME. If you can get past these elements, and enjoy a good survival game with a very well made story, then I can't recommend this game enough.
Is that a 9/10? that sounds like a 9/10.

Well there's 3 enemy factions that spawned right next to you, thats what. And when i say right next to you i mean like intestinal parasites next to you.
And they don't like to grab the nice little resources on the other side as well. Naah, they have to build 12 cities right next to you just to get to that OH SO PRECIOUS stone quarry.

If you are going to buy this, you should buy CS:S with it since many game modes use those textures in it.
Sandbox mode is nice, you can do many things in that but many people also love to play on game modes, I would recommend TTT as a nice game mode if you find a good server but the sky is the limit in Gmod gamemodes(actaully it is the engine but eh).

There are so many things to be said about this game and this review would go on for pages if you were to explain every single custom gamemode that is on garry's mod and you will get you 10/5/2.5 euro or whatever the price is out of it since there is constantly new content developed on servers.

Game trailers and prologue appeared to give the game story, But then it just went straight to mindless slaughtering of creatures you didn't really know anything about, other then the few bullet form points the prologue pointed out. A Pretty unexpected turn from how the trailers let on to be.  Once starting games like quick play and what not, it was host based, which 99% of the time appeared to end with the host leaving and or dcing which caused everyone to start over.

If you want to just mindlessly slaughter rats and what not, then you may like this, or I suppose if your a warhammer fan you will probably(?) like it. Though for me I know very little about the warhammer universe, and i thought the game would give a little more detail about what and why I was doing things. Becuase I knew so little about the universe, and the game didn't give much backstory, I expected to have more of an arsenal of skills to choose from as the game described it as having 4-5 characters with 15 career paths.

2243888,289070,Sid Meier's Civilization VI,49118503,english,"Civ 6 revolutionizes the civ franchise with unique mechanics. It will not be for everyone, but it is certainly a breath of fresh air.

Arguably the greatest change is the introduction of districts and it is my favorite change as well. For some it will take some getting used to, I came over from Endless Legend so I took to it instantly. The basic idea is to build buildings of any specific type, such as faith or science, you must first build a district, which takes up a hex on the map and gets bonuses to its yields depending on its location. For example, campuses get +1 science from each mountain tile, and +1 science for every 2 districts, they are adjacent to. This makes settling location and city planning far more important. 

Once you have a district built it unlocks the buildings of that type, campuses allow you to build libraries, universities, etc, and holy sites let you build temples, shrines, etc. The amount of districts you can build is limited by population, which means you must specialize your cities. If you are going for a science victory you may build campuses in most of your cities, but you will still need to build theater districts for culture and commercial hubs for trade routes and gold. You cannot build every district in every city, but with the exception of holy sites if you aren't going for religion, you will want to build every district somewhere in your empire. This also means that you can't dabble in multiple types of buildings or make a city that isn't specialized. If you do not have a campus you cannot build a library, so you can't have a city that has a library, amphitheatre, market, workshop, and light house in the same city. You simply won't have the population and/or space to support that many districts.

Wonders also take up tiles just like districts. Wonders and districts prevent those tiles from being worked so unlike civ 5 you can't create a 'wonder city' -- you'll run out of space and tiles to work! Many buildings in districts do add specialist slots to make up for losing the tile yield. Some wonders require very specific locations, such as being adjacent to a specific feature, like a mountain or river, being built on a specific tile, such as hills or tundra, or near a specific district, or even all tree at once. This can be very annoying because some of the restrictions are extreme, locking you out of the wonder completely if you happen to not have the right resource or tile anywhere on your current map, and these restrictions are quite common. However, I believe that these changes to wonders and the additions of districts add a further strategic element are a feature present in very few 4X games (I think only civ 6 and endless legend have districts in the entire genre)

The next major change and arguably the most controversial is the removal of policy trees and the addition of a whole new tech tree, the civics tree. The civics tree is researched using culture and unlocks faith buildings and a large variety of wonders. However it mostly unlocks governments and policy cards. Instead of policy trees, you have an ever growing tree of policies to choose from and a limited number of policies you can have active. While you no longer grow as powerful as you would with policy trees, you have much more flexibility. If someone declares war on you, you can switch out your more economic policies for bonuses to production and military strength to quickly build a strong army. There is a bit of a balancing issue, with certain policies staying relevant for the entire game or getting upgraded, and others quickly being obsolete. Other policies become auto includes and essentially reduce your number if policy slots. Governments determine what policy types you have access to, such as economic or military, and provide a small bonuses such as extra gold or more housing. The fact that there are two tech trees can cause some serious pacing issues as the game is balanced with the idea that you are split between both trees, but if you specialize in just the science tree you can unlock some techs ridiculously early. Ultimately I believe this change is very positive.

The addition of housing is a cool idea as it incentivizes settling near rivers, and limits growth if you don't have enough houses, but It ultimately falls flat. Amenities are far less transparent than happiness was. Housing and amenities simply become arbitrary numbers to keep track of. 

Finally, the ai is absolutely terrible. A serious step back from civ 5, and sadly becomes even worse with the latest expansion. The ai leaders have specific agenda that determine what actions annoy them off or not, one of which is predetermined by leader and one is random. These agendas can conflict making the ai's behavior feel very erratic and out of place. Also the random agenda is hidden to start, meaning that it's not immediately clear why the AI is mad at you and how to keep them happy. Also some of the leader specific agendas are way too specific. For example Victoria gets mad at you if she has no cities on your continent, but it can take her ages to settle on your continent, meaning she can be angry at you for much of the game with out any real way of placating her. Similarly, some empires get mad at you for settling near certain areas, such as the coast or mountains, but sometimes that can't be helped, especially if your first city is near a coast, or your civilization relies heavily on coastal bonuses. Whether the ai likes you or not feels arbitrary, especially early game.

Finally, I've had ai declare war on me for no apparent reason. I've a fully positive relationship, with literally no negative modifiers, settled far away from the ai, they did not covet my lands, and still they went to war.

In sum, I feel that this game is vastly unerappreciated, but you may find some of the new feature jarring and that can turn some people off. Additionally, with an unpredictable ai, the gulf between single and multiplayer means your mileage may vary.",1550664650,1551610521,True,2,0,0.511510372161865,0,False,False,False,76561198038854900,86,15,10538,0,3770,1600390339

2259595,289070,Sid Meier's Civilization VI,39976301,english,"Alright, so this game is definitely interesting.

There are a bunch of aspects I like and dislike about it, as well as general thoughts.

PROS:
The game (with the new DLC) is quite addicting. I found myself saying ""Just one more turn"" over and over again late into the night.
The cartoonish graphics are actually quite good once you get used to them.
The Music for the game is great.
The new Loyalty feature makes it so forward settling someone far away in the early game is near impossible, and makes late game colonialism diffiult (though not impossible). If you like to build up empires and keep to yourself you'll find you don't notice loyalty much, whereas if you used to like to dominate snowball to victory you're going to have the extra challenge of maintaing loyalty under your belt. Late game the challenge becomes easier to handle, so don't  worry too much about having trouble driving your tanks to Moscow.
Emergencies tend to happen with wars, I almost managed to have 3 emergencies at once, but sadly only had two. Backstabbing people, taking a city state or capital, or using a nuclear device all triggered emergencies against me. It was a bit fun, though I think it would've been better if I wasn't already at war with everyone.
The AI isn't as bad as what it's been made out to be. Whenever the game first came out, sure, everyone hated your guts. Now it's fairly easy to maintain relations with other nations if you so choose, just don't go on massive attempts at conquest and expect people to like you for it. Additionally, The AI actually managed to keep up with me on prince difficulty when I played at the new expansion, so I think the skill has certainly improved.
Governors are interesting. Depending on how many cities you build, you may only need a few of them (and thus you'll have very experienced governors) or if you build wide you'll need a lot (and you'll be shuffling them around a little to optimize your setup). I would say it's a great way to help give big bonuses to certain cities in certain areas, and can really help move things along.

CONS:
No Production Queue. This isn't so bad as it keeps the game moving, but it can be annoying if you want to stop paying so much attention to one place. That said, you can download a mod to fix this, but it hasn't been updated to work with the new DLC yet.
Mods don't work with the DLC yet. That's partially why I think we're seing so many crashes in the reviews, and why I crashed myself when I first started playing this game: I forgot I had mods enabled, and the mods haven't had time to update to work with the new expansion pack.
Free Cities do not turn into city states, you cannot systematically balkanize your fellow players. They will stay free despite outside influences sometimes though.
Map doesn't display my boarders (specifically mine) in game when zooming in and out near other cities, I don't entirely understand why this is. It makes using builders a bit confusing though.
I conquered every city in the game, won a culture victory. Go figure.

All in all, I believe it's worth getting the game with the expansion. Most of the bug issues or graphic errors that people have mentioned will inevitably be fixed with updates. 
I really enjoy playing Civ 6, and I think most people will too.

If I had to sum up Euro Truck Simulator 2 in one word it would be ""quality.""  From the sim engine, the graphics, the attention to detail of the developers, the interaction between the developers and the community and the community itself, quality shines through.

The company is being very well led.  They do what so few game developers these days seem to, they understand their product, the niche it fills in the market and their customers.  They are not afflicted with the relentless drive to grow the company at the expense of their products or customer base, as is so often the case with many companies these days.  They release a great product at a fair price and manage their costs to continue to do so.  No half baked money grabs.  No gimmicks.  Just good gaming value for your money.

I wish Euro Truck 2, this company and all it's employees much continued success in the future and personally thank them for their integrity and commitment to their wonderful products and customer base!

4798387,640820,Pathfinder: Kingmaker,45027985,english,"TL;DR: Semi-intuitive, NON-level-scaling (!!!), bit difficult in the beginning, but very nicely designed and developed game for RPG fans, especially those who love playing Baldur's Gate 1-2, Pillars of Eternity 1-2 or the old Fallouts. Needs some fine-tuning from devs, but all in all, a finely crafted RPG gem. Strongly recommended!

This game is long-awaited. There have been ""RPG"" releases that were a disgrace for the D&D name. Pathfinder: Kingmaker is The Patch to that festering wound.
The story seems good for now - I'm not yet finished with the game, in fact I'm still at the beginning of the good part. After getting your stronghold, you will have 2 (or rather 2.5) ways playing the game: managing your barony through events and decisions and going out with your party, playing the usual party-based RPG, which is also interrupted by some text-based events, where you can choose your path or action from a menu of options, just like old-fashioned interactive novels.
It's pause-with-space, with faily good AI for every character you can control. Enemy AI is acceptable too. [spoiler] Especially the fight with the Stag Lord, where he tends to aim at the main character as much as he can	[/spoiler]

[b] Gameplay settings [/b] For now this is the BEST improvement in RPG history. You can choose how to award XP for skill checks (one member receives XP or everyone), can choose whether all your characters get XP or only those in the party, and several other similar aspects of the game, which was a marvelous idea from the devs!

[b] Tutorials [/b] People, who are used to hand being held throughout a game, beware: here the [b] Tutorial does not cover every little bit [/b] of the GUI/mechanics/class/etc, you will have to learn the game by playing it and trying the buttons yourselves. Requires some intuition, yes. Kids below 12 (in age and/or IQ): ask someone to assist you, don't shout at the screen, it's no use.

[b] Level scaling: [/b] Encounters and areas are not 100% adjusted to party level! Whiners beware, you may find challenge that is too difficult for you on level 2-3, even with low difficulty. Those who complain about Vicomte Smoulderburn [spoiler] that blazing skull who appears when you rest at the camp remains near the Mites [/spoiler] , learn playing non-level-scaling games. Hope people remember Baldur's Gate 2, where you could meet liches even in the starting areas, while on level 8-9, getting killed in like 2 rounds. Go back for the Vicomte later. I myself hate level-scaling. Takes away 50% of the fun.

[b] Pathfinder ruleset compliancy (did I get the right word?): [/b] as much as I know Pathfinder rules, which is zero so I'm mostly comparing the game rules to D&D 3.5, it follows ruleset properly, maybe with some necessary minor modifications. Not so bold kick-in-the-groin blasphemy as merging magic schools illogically (invisibility in Transmutation...guess the game), using cooldown abilities or simplifying rules too much. Nothing of that. If you know any of D&D 3.5 PF 4ht 5th editions, you'll be pretty much familiar with everything.

[b] Character generation: [/b] Many classes and even more subclasses (I think every class has 3 subclasses aside from the vanilla class), some prestige classes, so you can spend a couple of hours creating your character, partly because you want to try more than one class and can't decide. I maybe felt a little overwhelmed by the number of options here...but it's just a very minor issue, not really a problem.
[b]Edit:[/b] I have to agree with many complainers that you need to know D&D 3 or later ruleset to understand everything during creation, the tooltips and clues are not too detailed.

[b] Overall difficulty: [/b] At the beginning there is a certain degree of sh*t hitting the fan all around you, the game is hard, and you need to choose your tactics carefully, sometimes change spell memorization (which means extra resting). Devs admitted the difficulty required some tuning, so the second hotfix addressed that. Maybe there's still some room for improvement concerning difficulty, but it's manageable, and will rather feel like a hard challenge than taking away the fun. Choose your terrain for the battles. You can lure the enemies, use the terrain to your advantage.
For the less patient gamers: buy a spare keyboard, just in case.
[b] Edit:[/b] I have to admit, sometimes I lose it too...game can really be damn hard, even during main missions that you cannot avoid (as they are timed quests). Oh for good fuck's sake.

[b] Graphics: [/b] Beatuiful. I especially like the tone of the coloring. Not too dark-gothic, but not even the swords with sugar-coating and rainbow-ponies kind of high saturation. Nice in-between pastel colors. But you can see the screenshots above LOL 

[b] Party: [/b] Till now I haven't seen any serious banter or fight between party members, even though it is er...quite colorful, concerning alignments. Romance...it will be there as far as I know, but I'm rather curious about the NPC remarks based on some of your decisions, or occasional (or inevitable?) alignment shift( s?). :)  [b]Edit:[/b] There ARE some consequences of not agreeing with your companions, slight quarrel or radical decisions from the companion, but they indeed react to your decisions! Some of these decisions are Barony events-related, not while you're out adventuring. No inter-companion banter though, however. Well, maybe I should let some highly different companions  [spoiler] like Ekundayo and Jaethal  [/spoiler] travel together for a reasonable time.

[b] Bugs: [/b] There are some (even after hotfix 1.0.6). The dev team is busy fixing them, even during weekends! However, I have to agree with those saying it would have been wiser to release the game 2 weeks later instead of releasing 7 patches in 2 weeks (hfix 1.0.7 has just downloaded) It's a little bit of a shame, but well...I am not aware of the background reason for insisting on releasing the game on the promised date. Maybe the press pressed them, maybe pride, maybe some financial reasons (sponsors, anything...hell I know)...not trying to defend them. Actually I did NOT meet too major and game-breaking bugs, even though the hotfix notes mention several bad ones. I was satisfied with the at-release-state of the game, though patching got me even happier.

Well, this game is still full of surprises I feel, so I may extend this review later. But all in all: it worth every penny you spend on this game.
Nice job, Owlcat Games! I'm glad I supported this game on Kickstarter. Not disappointed, but fully satisfied.",1538334438,1539107250,True,2,0,0.490196079015732,0,False,False,False,76561198114211900,482,6,17784,0,5699,1548196371

3740644,367520,Hollow Knight,31804445,english,"hello, don't remember writting a review so here it is :

This game is simply the concentration of everything that I love in a game. Clearly, it is the best game of 2017 for me so far.

so...

Why the F*** am I rating it like this and why would I strongly recommend that you don't buy it? Simply because this kind of games have to be perfect... Nothing less, nothing more! Symphony of the night is perfect, super metroid is perfect, order of ecclesia is perfect, metroid prime, zero mission, even cave story is perfect etc...
you know why they're perfect for me? BECAUSE YOU CAN ACTUALLY PLAY THE GAME!!!!

I have more than 30 hours on hollow knight and now I'am starting to try everything that is supposed to be hard like I use to in every metroidvania like, it seems that everything is doable to me.

EXCEPT...

UNITY! Unity micro freezes the game every once in a while (every 5 sec I mean...) and when it becomes harder, every fight is like a music sheet that you have to follow BY THE RULE! How can you do it if the game makes you miss every 2 or 3 hits because when you pushed the button... THE GAME WAS FREEZING!!!! HOW? 

I never felt this kind of frustration in any game in my life simply because... the game is fabulous! It is my favorite genre reborn with so much genius in it... But the most challenging parts can't be done... (without luck I mean, I'm guessing everyone is thinking : ""git gud noob"" ... whatever! I want every fight to be clean and if it wasn't for this b***S*** I wouldn't have spent my entire day on the third level of the arena...).

This kind of game based on precision and decision by the frame can not be released unfinished... It feels like the taj mahal built with white and solid vomit... it's beautiful, but man... IT SMELLS!!!


edit, a year later : I decided to do it another time. 0 micro freezes during 30 hours of gameplay!! Thank you team cherry for this absolute work of art. 15 out of 10 ^^

There's no doubt in my mind that Factorio is a superb and addictive game. I don't think I've played another game like it. The game is about building and maintain factories. You will be mining resources, researching technologies, building infrastructure, automating production and fighting enemies. You can use your imagination to design your factories, combine simple elements into ingenious structures, apply management skills to keep it working and finally protect it from the creatures who don't really like you. - Highly Recommended!",1456508669,1456574343,True,4,2,0.543329417705536,0,False,False,True,76561197970329300,2223,1239,1588,0,107,1598108421

[/list][/i]

[u]Intro[/u]
I just couldnt get into the ARK setting, however i did follow it's development closely. I was really hyped when i noticed they were releasing a ''Pirate theme'' version of it. 

[u]Positive[/u]
[list]
[*] Alot of things to craft.
[*] Sailing the map with a home made ship and friends is alot of fun.
[*] You can almost build every where.
[*] Water graphics/physics are well done.
[*] The way they implemented ship building is really cool, you have a to build all parts necessary for the ship, after that you can alter it's complete design and decide where you want to build cannons for example.

[/list]


[u]Neutral[/u] 
[list]
[*] Optimization, game not running very smooth.
[*] The seas feel a bit empty.
[*] Islands are too small.
[*] Getting a decent base is a fairly big grind if alone.
[*] Messy skill tree.
[*] Performance issues on starting islands.
[*] Switching and especially reloading weapons is buggy sometimes. (No shot chambered after reloading) 
[*] Foundations are too small, constructions like forge, loom etc. are too big.  
[*] Sometimes get stuck between rocks.
[/list]


[u]Negative[/u]
[list]
[*] Animals, holy shit what a mess are the animals and their AI. first, there are too many, every area is covered in way too many species. Second, their AI is just horrible, aggro is bad and when animals are fleeing they tend to get stuck or they just wander off only to run back at you 2 minutes later.
[*] The games rocky start, will explain below.
[*] Graphics are not bad, but i put it at negative because it's not even close to what they revealed at first.
[*] Alot of space on islands are already claimed due to the amount of claim flags people can place. This made us eventually leave the official server.

Oh man i've seen games with a rocky start, but this one is on the top, luckily things are getting calmer and the devs are trying their best to make it better day by day.
Sadly, this does not changed the fact that they delayed their release day several times without communication, besides that, their extended gameplay trailer that they showed us half December looked way too good than the actual gameplay.

At the moment of writing i played around 30 hours, mostly on a server where there were higher xp rates and get more resources from gathering just to get to know what this game offers late game aswell. We had alot of fun despite the issues the game has.

So far it's been fun and frustrating. I gave it thumbs up because i enjoyed those hours venturing around despite the plentiful bugs and server side issues.
If this game will get the same attention as they did with Ark then i'm pretty sure that the developers are able to make something very nice of ATLAS.",1546506454,1546516718,True,2,0,0.519685029983521,0,True,False,True,76561197981846200,417,15,15629,0,3028,1595064871
3656045,367520,Hollow Knight,68730843,english,"To be honest, this is one of the best games I ever played. I've never played any so-called ""metroidvania"" games before Hollow Knight, but I absolutely fell in love with the hand-drawn level design & art and the exploration of a mysterious dark world, accompanied with a soothing soundtrack when just exploring, and a solid soundtrack when in combat.
It isn't as hard as Dark Souls, but nevertheless a bit challenging from time to time.
What makes this game so great, is the advance of combat throughout the game, together with the developer's passion for design which put together many different unique areas to explore.
Since I first played the game when it was brand new, I experienced the addition of a few updates. They were never boring, always filled with interesting additional bosses and other stuff.

I do not regret any second I spent with this game, and I am really looking forward to seeing the release of Hollow Knight: Silksong. Hopefully it'll be a great successor.

And it's not just a farming game, either. You can farm, mine, fight, explore, socialise, fish...there's always something you can be doing. Also, the only thing that's needed is money (taught me a fair amount of money management, which can be quite handy irl as well). Don't like talking to people? Don't talk. Hate the fishing minigame with a passion? Don't fish. Think the mines are too scary? Don't mine. Yes, there are drawbacks to not doing these things, but its more of a lack of rewards that you would get from doing those things. While the story only goes as far as ""repair this building in one of 2 ways"", there's a good amount of lore if you want to get digging into certain characters. Also, with multiplayer now a thing, why not get some friends together and just chill together instead of tryharding your way through online matches?

Shit happens, honestly I am completely and utterly blown away by this game, right now my longest survival time is 10 days I built a small fortress by the beach complete with warning signs to attempt to deter the enemy. Each time they would attack a few would perish and a few would retreat and the next night they came in bigger numbers. The A.I. is intuitive, with the characters acting differently based on a wide range of various parameters you feel the anxiety as you look at them watching you, circling you, probing you for weakness to determine if youre a threat. This game for all it's alpha flaws is amazingly fun and I can honestly say that this is the only game i've ever played where I was legitimately unnerved and on edge.

4934400,552500,Warhammer: Vermintide 2,52023487,english,"TLDR: Left 4 Dead comparisons are fair, but in my opinion its a lot more fun.    More weapons, leveling system, beautiful world, and greater enemy variety to name a few things.   Game does have loot boxes but no cash shop so there is no concern there.   And the game gives them generously so it isn't grindy. 

Edit: game time is inflated due to strange bug where launcher remains open and has to be closed manually otherwise it thinks the game is running.   If you have an error where it says ""app is running"" when you try to start it even though it isn't open you need to end the Vermintide launcher in taskmaster.   So if I get up to thousands of hours, and you call BS you're probably right. 

Longform Review:
So Left 4 Dead but with Warhammer.   You've heard it, I've heard it, your mum has heard it.   That's what everyone has heard about it.   And... they're correct... to an extent.   However, that really shouldn't be a problem as long as the game builds on the premise of Left 4 Dead.   I mean I'm primarily an RTS player and the amount of similar mechanics across those games is substantial, but you don't see people saying ""Ooh another Command and Conquer Clone""   And I'm happy to say that Vermintide absolutely adds a good number of features along with the Warhammer reskin of Left 4 Dead.

For starters there's a sense of progression of your characters.  Left 4 Dead you're one of 3 admittedly very charismatic dudes and one equally enjoyable dudette that starts the first round with the same damn pistol and the same choice of shotgun or automatic weapon every... single... time.   Whereas with Warhammer, you have the option of being Victor Saltzpyre, the Pokey, wielding your rapier and impaling your enemies with far reaching forward thrusts, or Victor Saltzpyre the Headsmasher, wielding a flail and washing yourself clean in the blood of the heretics you smash in a wide arc right in front of you.  And there's a lot of weapons more outlandish then that like repeater pistols and flamethrowers and various other pest exterminating tools.   Adding on to that are various different ultimate skills that you can unlock for characters, and then skill points you unlock to alter your characters playstyle further.   So all in all there's a lot of alteration you can do so whatever character you pick like Victor Saltzpyre or... the other slightly less awesome ones... you can make it feel like you.

But I hear you say.  That just gives you an excuse to grind the shit out of the game like a Skavenslave on a treadmill.  And depending on if you're a masochistic looter shooter enthusiast or someone like me who likes not having gaming as a second job, you may be either excited by this prospect or reluctant.   For me as someone who wards away grindy games like Destiny with a crucifix, I feel no obligation to grind.   I've been able to accrue a massive amount of loot boxes just from leveling and have been able to try different weapons as I please.    An important thing to know is once you unlock weapons you can craft them.   So if you want that flamethrower for your dwarf because ""Holy crap it's a FLAMETHROWER"" the good news is you can dissassemble things for scrap to get one and the conversion rate isn't bad.  You get three items in a loot box that you can melt down each round you finish, and honestly like two boxes worth or less is usually enough.   You might not get great stats on it but until you get into really high level endgame, the extra stats are gravy and you don't really need them.   You can also use scrap to upgrade weapons too so if you really care, there you go.  

Honestly though for me as a filthy casual, who looks on at actual good players game play with a near erotic longing, I mainly care about story and environment.   And Vermintide.... mainly delivers on environment with the story being told in snippets and exchanges between characters.   Essentially the Skaven have collapsed a big ass city, and have a green stargate in the ruins beneath that they'll use to march Norsca chaos soldiers through.   And you have to stop it.  And you do.  The end...

 But the world.... oh my god it's beautiful.   And I mean it, it really is beautiful despite also being an apocalyptic craphole.   And honestly that really captures the essence of Warhammer.   Even as the world burns and falls into ruin it's magnificent and beautiful, and that makes the tragedy all the more enjoyable and also impactful.   I wish so much that other apocalyptic landscapes took this to heart but too often it's brown, dead, and horrible to be in and look at.   And I think that's a mistake.  I genuinely do.   

It's all these additions and the love and care put into the game that honestly make ""Left 4 Dead with Rats"" a bit of a double edged sword.   On one hand it does sum up the basic experience so people know what they're getting into but it does a bit of a disservice to what I think the game accomplishes.   But I suppose ""Left 4 Dead with Lovingly Crafted Environments, More Weapons, More Enemy Types, And Overall Yet Another Fantastic Addition to the Warhammer Game Canon...... with Rats"" doesn't roll off the tongue.

Presentation: 10/10 - Each pixel is beautifully rendered and lovingly placed to burn a hole directly through your skull with enduring love.

Gameplay: 10/10 - With simplistic yet unforgiving controls, this game will have you high fiving your best friend one minute, and smashing your face into your desk for sweet release the next. 
*Keyboard and mouse compatible, as well as Gamepad compatible.

Sound: 10/10- With a soundtrack that feels like it was ripped right out of the 90's, it fits right in sync with the mind-numbing sound effects that will have your ears bleeding from extreme brutality.

Replay Value 10/10: What exactly is ""Replay Value""? If it's in the sense of playing the game over again, then I can tell you I am almost 100% positive once you complete this game fully you will never want to play it again, unless to show someone else or submit yourself to more torture. That being said, you are going to put so many hours into this game that it justifies the $12 price tag ten times over. You are going to die so many times that technically you can consider that your ""replay value"". If you beat the game and feel like it's not hard enough for you, then you can go back through the first level and not die. At all. Do not die, get to the end of the level, and defeat the boss. In one sweep. You will then exit off of the stage and be taken to a seperate set of levels that are called the ""Path of the Valkyrie"". These levels are much more challenging and give you all of the migraines you crave. Enjoy!

Review Summary:

Never have I played a game for four hours straight to still be on the first level.

I am on the fourth level now and I have put 23 hours into this game.

It teaches you how to play by spanking you like a little school girl.

You will yell. You will cry. You will never laugh. You will step by step memorize enemy locations, level traps and upgrades to the point of madness...and then you'll continue to the next level and do it all over again.

There is one checkpoint in between each level, splitting them into two for each world. There are six worlds in total, making it twelve levels total. If you do not make it to the checkpoint then you will start at the very beginning upon death.There is a boss fight at the end of each world.

You have two weapons the entire game: a sword and a spear. Use these to navigate and decimate your way through each uniquely designed world. There are upgrades. If you can manage not to take any damage, each upgrade you get builds on top of the last one. It starts with a wooden shield, next upgrade is a metal shield and you can charge your spear throw. After that comes a viking helmet, then a flame sword. Only once you have claimed all of these upgrades can you truly claim you are still only mediocre at this game. There is also a bonus item you can find called Mjolnir, that gives you temporary invulnerability.

BEWARE: This game instills hope just as fast as it takes it from you.

The radio makes truck driving more realistic, because well... you know we listen to music when we drive.

There are loads of people on the multiplayer server. But first you need to have played 2 hours before you can download the mod for the game.

It's funny, it's surprisingly well-written (for both kids and adults), the voice acting is actually quite good, the levels are well designed and fun, the art style is great, and it's probably the cutest game I've played yet, with unlockable hats and colour schemes for Hat Girl.

Oh, and the soundrack is wonderful! There's a huge variety of songs, most of which change slightly depending on what you are doing. It's just a delight to listen to while playing, sets the tone really well and gives off a really great positive and happy vibe overall.

It is very clear that the team at Gears for Breakfast put a whole lot of love into this game. It shows in every aspect, from the big things, like the level design and characters, to the little things like a dedicated blow-kisses button. Cute as puppies.

It took me 16 hours to collect all 40 Time Pieces, and it was worth it and totally achievable for the average player, I'm happy they decided not to have something ridiculous like 800 like in Super Mario Odyssey, sometimes less is more.

Also as a bonus, this is probably the first 3d platformer with official mod support. Great stuff.  

If there were any criticisms I have of the game, it would be that the way you get new hats with different abilities is a little weirdly paced (I unlocked a hat long before I actually got to the level where it is actually useful) and that some hats are a little underutilized. Also, sometimes there was a bit too much dialogue and not enough platforming in one or two levels, but that's about it.

If you love 3d platformers like Mario and Banjo-Kazooie, then look no further. This is probably the best one.",1521974180,1521989847,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198041674000,416,31,1843,0,964,1564913169

I warmed up with a loss or 5 then went all in with all items and tryharded. I'd like to think he was there and watched with me. It was probably the most satisfying moment in my life... Then i got gud and played it all over again and again and again and took all endings.

The mechanics are the most satisfying i have tried in any game. I cannot wait to see what else from software  will make.

-The new ""nurse"" character seems ridiculously overpowered, although this could just be because I'm a noob
-Poor optimization - my computer runs most games on ultra but I had to drop down to medium to get a steady FPS

Pros: + Graphics are Great for a 2004 game
         + Source Engine not Demanding
         + Has alot of Fun mods and gametypes

Cons: - Not as Popular as CS 1.6 nor CSGO
         ± Feels Different From other games of the same Series, Some like it some don't, but all in all 
             you Should give it a try.         
            
          - Is 5$ more expensive than the Latest instalment (Counter-Strike: Global Offensive) Also it is the Most expensive    
             Counter-Strike on The Market

Verdict: It's a great game if you have 20$ to spend on a Random game, but if you are looking for a Counterstrike Game, i would recommend Counter-Strike:Global Offensive Or Counter-Strike 1.6

Anything that has (metroidmania) (souls like) in their bio should be avoided, for it is a clear sign of being devoid of creativity and a red flag for, ""We dont know what we're doing but we played Mario and DS1 once so I think we can make a game."" Story is another vague too deep for you bore. I hope you like reading walls of text for hours. Idk, maybe if you're thirteen you'll find the story interesting but even so its nothing you have'nt seen before but with bugs this time. The Ai is below a Ps1 game level of intelligence, enemies will jump off cliffs and attack through walls. Enemies and bosses will spam the same abilites which will lead to guranteed damage, completly unfair. Would'nt mind the unfair spam as much but the walk back to where you died takes far too long. You'd think the level design team would know how to make a shortcut but nope. The most ""souls like"" thing in this game is the bad camera and input delay (not often but still present) which will lead to a bunch of damage and deaths. An upgraded weapon doesn't make you feel more powerfull it's just one or two enemies take one less hit sometimes. Idk if this is a glitch but enemies take a random amount of hits to kill sometimes. Upgrades and buying items cost so much you'd think this is an Ubisoft game. The map is the worst, it doesn't come with a compass and you have to buy a new one for every area ""usually for too much money"", from some guy in a random spot which you can't find because you don't have a map. A poor map and a vauge story will leave you wandering for hours through places you've seen six or seven times and it sucks. When other games do this they get flamed and Hallow Knight should be no exception. I could go on about how revisiting the same areas so many times makes them lose their charm and how alot of the level design is bad but I've gone on too long.

1. Item Trading.
The ability to hold out an item to trade during a trial, where both can see the others item, and both can press the secondary action button to accept, or walk away to decline. This could let survivors know before they drop their item what they're getting, or to see what item their teammate has.

2. Chest Skill Checks
Survivors will have skill checks (not affected by Killer skill check perks) to determine the durability, tier, and possibly, if running Ace in the Hole, add-on's. This would help change the courses of games, and depending on how well you do, your life. Perks like Plunderers could be used to affect Skill Checks on chest as well.

3. Community Made Run/Walk Cycles
Competitions for new (dev approved) animations for certain effects could be held, where the winner's could be implemented as a buy-able swap-out for the normal (normal running and walking being most costly, rarely seen ones (such as Tier 3 Insanity Doctor's) being the cheapest. This would allow more diversity, yet still no insane or unrealistic qualities, to how Survivors or Killers look.

4. Secondary Items
These would be one use items, separate in key bind and use, from main items. These could be used much like firecrackers, having a single use while still bringing a dramatic new amount of possibility to synergies and overall gameplay. This is the biggest stretch of all these suggestions, but still could be something to look at.

Workers alone cannot build roads anymore, making things seem more slower. AI is awkward and cannot defend their own cities, maybe because cities can no longer hurt units defensively.

This game is without a doubt a huge creative blast for the gaming industry. An example of out-of-the-box thinking that has grown like ivy throughout the game world. An example of how to create something that will be imprinted in memory and will pass through the years with its head held high. An example of how you can create something without the numbers ""6-7-8"" in the name, creating a whole new universe with such manic pedantry and attention to detail that many can only envy this. Hideo Kojima in this game acts as either a desperate prophet, or a chaotic demiurge of lonely spaces of art, or a creator who personally detonates the very Big Bang that is so important for this game. It is difficult to deny the influence that this game has had by the mere fact of its appearance, just as it is now difficult to deny the undoubted influence of Hideo Kojima on the development trends of the modern gaming world.

A lot in «DEATH STRANDING» is aimed at the idea of unification. In the role of a courier, plowing the endless lonely expanses of America, having survived a massive catastrophe, you feel so lonely that something is shrinking inside. But you are always aware of your goal, your highest destiny - to be the thread that sews the scattered scraps of a surviving society. And therefore the main character - Sam Bridges very quickly moves from the screen into you, and the problems of this world become your problems. The plot is so complex that it is almost impossible to tell it without spoiling the impression of the future game. We will limit ourselves only to the fact that it is as crazy as possible, incredibly perfected in its aesthetics, but at the same time it does not cross the border of good taste.

The most important thing here is not even the perfection of the visual, not the impeccably created scenery of the dying world, not even the incredible main plot, filmed with the participation of world cinema stars. The main thing is the feeling of the game world, the feeling of one's unity with other players, the pure emotion that this game gives. It is impossible to convey the feeling when you make routes that no one has walked, leaving help for future players, feeling the pride of a pioneer. Or, when you suddenly discover that through a gorge that would have to go around for a long time, one of the players carefully threw a ladder, leaving it for the future, simply because you have one goal. It is not just that many jokingly say that ""why are you interrupting my wonderful courier adventures with some kind of plot."" And this is an incredible gaming experience that is difficult to overestimate, infinitely far from the falsity of the ""open"" world of many multiplayer games. This is not just a game, but something more, and no more words are needed.",1595882752,1595882836,True,39,4,0.718618273735046,0,False,False,False,76561198048668300,6061,214,3910,0,739,1598788647

So after 520 hours I will make a short review:
Many people complain about bugs and yes they exist, but the only one that is a little problem actually is that it is difficult to get a lobby in Survive with friends. 
BUT: after a learning curve (you rather won't be a master after some hours: after about 100 hourse you start to get good and know the maps, clever hiding spots etc.
It is indeed very addictive, as a Survivor your heart will pump wildly while being chased especially at the beginning. As a Killer you will feel adrenalon in your veins and be uncalm sitting on your chair, holding your face close to the screen and trying to catch Survivors.
The best and worst thing in this game is that there is no AI: every player is a real life person. The community can be great and on the other side really salty, but the fun moments will be more often.

3999344,581320,Insurgency: Sandstorm,49575774,english,"This game is off the hook! It has a feel of NovaLogic's Delta Force series and Joint Operations. The map style is especially reminiscent of that genre. It also reminds me of a more grown up version of the infantry combat in BFBC2 without all the neon junk, hit markers, and poor hit registration issues. When all you can do is use the words ""feel"" and ""remind"" it means this game obviously is its own unique qualities! 

There is good 3D positional sound and the weapons and explosives sounds  (while maybe not surpassing Post Scriptum) immerse you into the game. I am cutting my teeth in Coop and it is hard to tell the difference between AI and human players. Highly recommend!

I'll keep you posted!

10/02/2019 Here is  some follow-up. I now have 500 hours of play time in the game. The developers are very active in their support and continuing development of the game. 

I wish to leave some very subjective thoughts on the multiplayer PvP aspect of the game. The weapons are very lethal and the time to kill is very low. It is unforgiving if someone cannot camp. I always favored objective style game play and I never had much interest in team death match. There is one objective mode they call ""Push"". One side attacks and captures the enemies positions and the other defends. The other is called ""Frontline"" and each side has a base to defend and in the middle is a neutral base to capture.

In the Frontline game mode, both sides are pushing to capture the same base at the same time. So goes the theory. In practice, most of  the players on both teams are no where near the objective and they are simply sniping or they are not attempting to capture but are simply looking to ambush. It works that way because because of the time to kill (ttk). I say it is very frustrating to have to suffer the poor team death match players who find their way into the objective game mode only to continue to play tdm against the objective cappers. Many never attempt to capture a point even as the last man on their team.

This is an old gaming problem made worse by the weapons. The game scoring DOES reward the captures, so it's not uncommon for the top scorer having a barely 1 to 1 or negative K/D ratio. Some may say that is ""tactical realism""game play. This is like Arma without the awkward clunky character movement or overly involved game mechanics.

That is why I can't thumb down the game. I would prefer ""Tactical Arcade"" where there is more to the gun play. Gun play where you can be ambushed by a camper, but with a slower TTK, through clever character movement, a cool head, and steady aim and weapons control you can still prevail. Especially in close quarter combat. That is opposed to the gun game experience here: ""I'm camping and ready to open fire, you are on the move to the objective, I see you first, PEW PEW you're dead, death simulator"".

There are times that you happen to fall in with some good tactical minded players on a public server who are interested in smartly working the objective. It is those times that are HIGHLY gratifying and FUN! They're not interested in going off alone to hide in some shadow to just ambush players for 10 seconds of gun firing in a round. If you can team up with friends on a server you will derive the most amount of satisfaction from this game. I share these thoughts to help someone make the best buying decision for their gaming fix.",1552664427,1570033437,True,7,0,0.566464245319367,1,True,False,False,76561197981683900,41,1,30756,0,3395,1603665896

However it just needed to be expanded upon and it would have been a fantastic game. Unfortunately that isn't what happened. Six years later and the game has changed on a fundamental level, and not for the better. I'm not even sure you could call this game an RPG anymore.

[b]Just a few things of note:[/b]
[list]
[*]Skill trees have been removed from the game, with nothing to replace them.
[*]Levels and experience have been removed from the game.
[*]No skills to unlock.
[*]None of the gear is interesting, it's all simple stat upgrades, there are no passive abilities, hit effects, or anything like that.
[*]Every time you leave your region all of your gear gets taken away.
[*]There is no reason to fight 95% of enemies.
[*]The strength level of all the enemies in every region is the same, the game never gets any harder than your first region.
[/list]

You can also collect things like hang gliders and boats but the moment you leave an area it all gets taken away for no reason and you have to find it all again. There is no in game justification for any of this either. It's completely baffling. If I collect a boat in one region and try to sail into a neighboring ocean the boat will [b]DISAPPEAR WHILE I'M RIDING IT. [/b] The game is chock full of things like this where it feels like the developer is just trying to waste your time.

There are zero progression mechanics beyond tiny upgrades to your movement ability that take hours to get. I'm talking about things like sailing 2% faster, swimming 2% faster, etc.
[i][b]I'm not kidding, this is the only form of permanent character progression in the game.[/b][/i]

Once you've played for a few hours you've seen everything the game has to offer, there is no reason to go to different regions, the gameplay is fundamentally the same thing over and over. There is no real progression or variety.

I could keep going on about every single confusing design decision in this game but that wouldn't really add anything, the game just isn't fun. Consider it a cautionary tale for why developing a game in complete isolation with no outside feedback for 6 years may be a bad idea.",1569863736,1569863884,False,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,76561198003507200,293,1,249,0,249,1569292912

However, it needs serious balancing—which I believe will achieve thanks to the community feedback. I have only played with China so far, and thus I must restrict my suggestions to that nation alone. 
China suggestions: 
-The wall takes forever, not because of the factors you would imagine but because it uses tiles that are acquired very slow.
-Could you imagine what would have been like if the Great Wall had ladders on both sides? Yes, it would have defeated the purpose of the defense—well, that is how it works in the game; the enemy has the same access to the Great Wall that China has. So it is just a football game to see who gets to jump on the wall first. You can't occupy every single tile of the wall with units, so they jump on it and attack you—with all the full defense benefits of the wall on their side. In other words, you built a platform for your enemy. 

Please, let's make China Great Again and fix that wall.

* It doesn't hold your hand. You have to think once in a while. It is refreshing. 
* Visually it is very beautiful.
* Red Panda! 

BUT...

* It doesn't hold your hand it doesnt tell whats going on properly. quest log is desastrous. you have to check the internet for solutions multiple times. 
* It is not unforgiving it if unfair. Almost cheating at times. Shelyn paladin bossfight, enraged owlbears. 
* Sometimes makes you feel like you are playing d&d with a DM that hates you. Unfair fights. Having to save (and load multiple times) before every lock and trap. At the first levels healing is a problem too. 
* Annoying companions and annoying npcs. DM definitely hates you. Ridicules you at every opportunity. You are supposed to feel like a baron but noo. 
* Has some silly design decisions like - carrying around 50 kilos of food but the game tells you that you don't have enough rations and have to hunt but cannot hunt indoors.-  
* Production quality is meeh. 
* Voice acting is amateurish. A lot of the Player character voices are annoying 
* Assumes you are very familiar with the tabletop pathfinder rules. 
* Plot seems nice. Well they have Chris! it has to be. (Well after playing for 80 hours, plot is very mediocre after all so moving this to negatives. Chris has disappointed me big time.)
* And after sooo many patches it still has annoying bugs that cripple your gameplay. 
* Loading times are ridiculous even when installed on a ssd. 
* While music has its moments once in a while, it got old very quickly and i turned it down at one point. 
* I would have refunded if i understood what the game really is at the first 2 hours. It starts relatively bug free and balanced then it loses its nuts. 

Do i recommend it? For tabletop rpg fans maybe..
For others? No. Stay away. Wait for the devs to fix bugs and change wrong game design decisions. 

One little advice to the Devs. Please find a proper Game Designer. This is not the way to make computer games. Seriously I feel like Game Cheates multiple times. What was that ridiculous fight with valeries mentor guy the paladin.

Yes, there are bugs here and there, graphical ones mostly, but overall it is a real work of art with some great attention to detail.

Celeste is game which takes part with a young girl by the name of Madeline, trying for some reason to climb Celeste mountain. During the intro Madeline discovers she has a unique ability which allows her to dash in any direction quickly. This dash ability creates for some challenging tasks which requires accurate button presses.

There are 8 chapters which have multiple levels in each, (with over 700 levels in the whole game!) and each chapter a new game mechanic is added. For example: In the first chapter there are platforms which move when you touch them, and then stop giving you momentum in order to cross a large gap in the level, the 5th chapter when you dash some platforms with move instantly and slowly return. Which can lead to some interesting level designs. 

Celeste rewards exploration. In each chapter there are multiple strawberries you can collect which don't really do anything and are usually far off the main story but it is nice collecting all the strawberries and feeling like you have beat that chapter 100%. In each chapter there is a cassette tape you can pick up called a B-Side which unlocks a far far significantly more difficult level, which can keep you trying, and trying again, and again until you give up and come back tomorrow and then smash that piece of impossibleness trash away with you're super amazing skillzzzzz you got.

Overall the game is worth the $19.99 USD.

-Amazing soundtrack
-Beautiful pixel graphics
-Unique chapter design keeping the game from going stale
-Far far far difficult B-Side levels

This game seems fine to people who haven't really played or invested any time into past paradox games, but people who have share very similar sentiments involving the serious lack of features and for good reason. The game often might as well play itself as you have very little in the way of choice. There is basically no depth to any of the systems and mechanics in the game. You should not be able to learn the ins and outs of a grand strategy game in less than an hour. This game really feels like a cash grab to lure more casual players into sinking as much money as they can squeeze out of them and farm good reviews from those dog dookie websites. I have no problem with CK3 being a simpler game than its predecessor as hell, my monkey brain could never get a hold of being able to play it but what I do have a problem with is the abhorrent lack of features that will be pushed out in future DLC and for a 30 DOLLAR price tag, I wonder how much its actually going to cost before you can play the true base game before it was chopped up and locked behind future paywalls. I didnt have as much problems with them milking the ever loving hell out of ck2 and eu4 because those were great games that you would likely get some return on investment on, but I am very doubtful of how much future dlc can actually add to this experience.

4977409,397540,Borderlands 3,83606342,english,"A bit disappointing.  As a big fan of the first two games, I had high hopes for this one.  I feel like I should enjoy it too, but ultimately I found the game kind of boring.  I finished the game with one character, got 2/3 with two others before I got bored and quit, and only did two-and-a-half of the DLCs with the max-level character before I was bored out of my brain and uninstalled.

Visually the game is very similar to BL2, with some enhancements along the way.  The usual iterative improvements you would expect.  Similarly, the gameplay is improved over BL2.  In this area I feel the improvements were more significant.  The enemies, locations, gun-generation, drop-rates, fundamental combat gameplay, etc, are all significantly improved.  In terms of pure gameplay, I would consider this the best game in the series.  All the more reason why I find it bewildering that I ultimately got bored.

The writing is perhaps the game's weakest area.  Many of the characters are badly written, and many returning characters feel like the writer did not understand them.  The jokes often fall flat, which is bad in a game that lays them on pretty thick.  The main villains are terrible, as is the Mary Sue in the supporting cast, but both of these complaints are well-documented all over the internet.

The quest writing is also quite frustrating, with most quests taking the ""Haha, you thought that was the end?  No, we just changed the rules!"" approach.  I think this was one of the things that most impacted my enjoyment of the game, as quests tended to drag-out and get boring/frustrating long before I finished them.  I was bored and wanted to do something else, but the conditions just got changed again.  Level design also conflated this.  While the levels were interesting, they tended to feel too long.  That size with lots of alternate paths for different side-quests would not have been so bad, but instead they tended to be one main path and if you did not do the side-quest on the first pass... well, you just added an extra 30 minutes travel-time when you go back for it.",1609370535,1609370535,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198024894600,340,64,8539,0,8539,1597194220

2748732,253230,A Hat in Time,40941799,english,"[h1] Preface:	[/h1]
As a child, I grew up with platformers, hell, I had never played an FPS until a year and a half ago. Platformers have been the main games I have been playing for years, until I bought my mega-pc 2 years ago. So when I heard that a [u] brand new Mario game was coming out	[/u] on the Switch, I was joyed to come back to my childhood. I played the game, and was crippingly dissapointed. The game was 90% filler, 5% dull tasks and 5% fun. The game offered no challenge at all and treated basic movement patterns as a rewards. To be sure it wasn't just my skill, I went back and played Galaxy, Galaxy 2 and 64, it is just odyessy being trash. I wanted something [u] new, fresh, fun and at least somewhat challenging.	[/u] The main games I had heard about being a platformer similar was Yooka-Yaylee. Bad game. And I have been hampering after what Mario odyessy should have been. Then I found a small little indie game: A Hat In Time.

[h1] Gameplay:	[/h1]
The most important part of a platformer. The gameplay. Does it feel good? Answer: Hell yes. The control scheme was so damn tight it is completely playable on keyboard and mouse. The way Hat Kid controls is great. Combine this with badges which change gameplay, levels which can offer challenge and most importantly variety. Just like the amazing platformers you rememeber. With mod support now added for free [spoiler] (take notes Edward Mcmillan, you hack fraud) [/spoiler] even more opportunities were added. The hats start off basic, but do a good job of creating an almost metroidvania of going back to levels to test and try out new things, it could be argued that they are not too creative, but they do a great job of streamlining the experience. No complaints in the gameplay department. 

[h1] Graphics:	[/h1]
The cell-shaded department here really carries this particular part. I can imagine in a few years this looking rather out-dated, as the graphics are fine, but only just, hence the style preventing a completely awful write-up. That's not saying the game looks bad however, as the colour pallete not only changes in level, but in sub-sections of the level (called Acts within the game.) Don't get the wrong impression this style and combo of graphics will do until HIT2. Just.

[h1] Atmosphere:	[/h1]
This game oozes charm. From an old western train with an amusing over the top scottish owl from a haunting forest and an old woman gone mad from her lover leaving her chasing you. The voice actors completely annihalate here, each one with great writing and unique character design. A huge shoutout to Yungtown as a ghost 'Snatcher' (He is a youtuber apparently, never watched him.) and Xander Mobus  as the Conductor, absolutely clean house with some amazing voice acting, as well as Jontron really showing his worth in a few lines, would have liked to see a little more from him. And the soundtrack, my word. Absolutely stellar, both the OST and the remixes are great, you can tell the composers really had fun with these tracks, if you look up the OST, songs which should only really play for about 30 seconds max, like the classic pokemon 'you win' tracks, go on for several miniutes and aren't used, presumbly because they are jsut so damn fun to record. And hell, I love them too,

[h1] Longevity:	[/h1]
Free DLC will be added, and Gears for Time have taken a poll asking if people want even MORE content in paid DLC form. Sticking to your original Kickstarter promises AND THEN still giving content to those who pay for it is a great move, and I fully expect to buy DLC for this. Modding support has been added as previously mentioned, as well as extended and remixed tracks in the B-Sides soundtrack DLC. Beautiful. Looking over forums and so on, not only are the devs fairly active, but kind too. This game has the opportunity to really push out some damn good content, and to keep sales fairly high for the next couple of years, and these guys deserve it. 

[h1] TL:DR	[/h1]
Despite costing less than Mario Odyessy, and Yooka-laylee for the devs AND ourselves this game surpasses them easily, becoming an instant classic, up there with the best of them.

Except this, the game is exactly like the previous two games. If you liked those games, this is more than a must-buy. If you didn't, buy it anyway. It is a great game from beginning to end (even if the plot leaves on an unresolved cliffhanger)

I got this game when it left early access, and when I tried to play it, it would crash every 10 minutes.  That now seems to be corrected in the latest beta patch (so would expect it to be ok next full patch).  It seems to me that it's a recurring theme in all early-access titles (that make it to full release) that they test and develop the game over years with the community, but then release their full-release patch without first testing with the community.  

The game is still littered with bugs:

1. Items and plants respawn on reloading game.  This is touted as a ""Feature"", but if you've got to rely on exploits to make the world in your game sustainable, that's a bug.

2. When cooking in a cooking pot, instead of cooked food/broth, it spawns another empty pot (really)

3. You can't remove/change armour (really).

4964776,1222700,A Way Out,84108757,english,"[b]Technical bit[/b]
I played this game with my friend, in fact, I bought him a copy too (even though I didn't need to), because it was easier to set up. I have two other friends who have played the whole game through on some third-party software on only one PC, but it didn't work for me and my other friends as much as we liked to. Therefore we opted for connecting trough Origins friend invite (yes, this game requires Origin launcher even on though it’s sold on Steam ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ ). That's as much as is needed to be said about the technical oddity of this game. (The oddity being a co-op only, split screen gameplay). 

[h1]Now to the verdict: [/h1]
[b]Story and Gameplay[/b]
As we played the game, we greatly enjoyed the story, pacing and the mélange of different ideas. Some scenes a very fun, well thought out and cunning camera cuts between the two-character perspectives - I especially loved the Street Fighter -esque gameplay my friend got in one of the levels - which helps the game to always keep things fresh, which made the whole experience feel just right and action packed at the right moments. 

There are some minor plot holes in the story, and there are some things which seem as plot holes when in reality, they are actually great plot twist, as long as you can connect the dots :P Way easier to spot on a second playthrough, yet I can't imagine playing this game once more, when you've seen it, you've seen it all. 

Well okay, there are some points, in which the story differentiates. It's often a difference between choosing one characters ideas/plans over the other ones, which lead to different gameplays (often stealth vs action), yet after having tried some of them out, they did feel a little underwhelming, compared to what we both had envisioned would be happening.

Gameplay, although it had all of the above going for it, still had some... minor inconveniences. Maybe it was because we were playing on a keyboard, but the movement and actions felt sometimes unresponsive and clunky. We also encountered 1 or 2 bugs, after which we were forced to restart. Happily, the checkpoints are frequent, so it didn't matter that much in the long run. 

[b]Graphics[/b]
There were also a couple of different graphical issues. Saying that, I don’t mean bugs in graphics (which although were on highest settings, didn’t match my expectations. Looks good enough, but could be better), but in the motion capture cut scenes, like both characters forgetting a gun on the table in one of the cutscenes, yet in next cutscene, one of them is holding the exact same gun in his hand. That's either magic, or a bug. I opt for the latter :P 

[b]Price[/b]
I would definitely recommend the game, but price of 30 euro is a bit too much. I bought it on a sale where it costed 10 euro, and that a price is way more adequate for this game, in our both humble opinions. (I remind you, I bought the game twice, so the total is 20 euro instead of 60 euro, a terrific difference. And I did it simply for the my and my friend’s convenience). 

There you have it! The good, the bad, and the pricing.

Can´t help myself but this feels like ""Generic survival game No 214"" 

Pros: 

+Cool ""Backpack"" menu
+Well done crafting book
+Your Char is using ""BIC"" lighters
+Throwing spears

Cons:

-Story feels like its made in a 5 min rush cause they needed a story
-Bugs
-Graphics only OKish
-Wood chopping simulator

In its core The Forest is just your Generic Survival game. Collect food, build shelters, go to bed and kill Zombies ... Sorry meant Cannibals....

Sure the Developer added some Ideas of their own like the cool Backpack menu or the good looking Survivalbook, but after all... its just another Survival-game.
Besides this ""gimmicks"" and the fact that there are Cannibals rather then generic overused Zombies...  there is nothing that makes this game different to that 100 other Survivals that flooded Steam.

The Story is told in a 1 min cutscene at the beginning of the game, basicly ""save that child wich u seen in that 10 seconds before your Plane crashed""  i guess its the son of the Mainchar, after that there are just a few collectable pictures wich... are supposed to... what exacly?  There is no emotional binding to that child, you dont know if it is even your son. Nothing that makes you actually wanna save it...  and tbh i didn`t, still discovered pretty much all of the Map and only missed out 2-3 caves...

There are no other Roleplay elements, your Char is just a Nameless guy who got the power of Craftmanship...  He/She must be a Master Carpenter. You can (as soon as you got the ressources) craft Spears, Bows, huge buildings and so on. 
No advancing in skills, no learning....  Your Earlygame Bow is as Deadly as a Bow can be, ignoring the fact that making a wooden Bow (that can be used for Hunting/Killing) in RL (especially without any Tools beside a Stoneaxe) is a damn hard and require years of training. Same goes for lit everything else.
You also dont need actuall tools to build anything, just your axe to chop trees...   If you wanna build something just place the blueprint and fill it with the needed things, usually logs...

Graphics are running on max with my 1060Ti and... mmmh they´re ok, no Frostbite engine but who needs it... Only the lighing is sometimes really immersion breaking. Shaddows for example feel especially by night pretty cheap.

I had quite some goodwill with Steam Greenlight games but after the 200st survival game.... nah...
There are just not enough things that make this game feel different. 
Nothing that makes this Uniqe.
Its another generic Survival game.

Tbh i don´t like Survival games anyways, never bought a single one (even tho i got a lot of them for free to play with the one or other Survival infected friend) and got even this for free from a pal...
So maybe a Survival fan will see this as ""the choosen one"" but for me...  
Its one of hundred others.

Maybe with some really Unique Ideas besides the Menu... or the BIC lighter...
Maybe with a small story, building up emotions so you actually care about that child...",1574230316,1574230955,False,0,0,0.476190477609634,0,True,True,False,76561198086136800,73,12,1495,0,1495,1526502484

This game runs embarassingly bad for its graphics.

The biggest issue I have with this game, and the reason I just cannot recommend this game are the bugs, from minor inconveniences like the countdown timer for fast travel in a multiplayer lobby only showing up on the first fast travel of the session, to crashes to desktop, a common one many people encounter is crashing to desktop when they try to load into the Guts of Carnivora, however the ones I experienced were not consistent nor did they ever occur in the same location twice.

Literally probably my favorite game and first Kojima game. In a way the game literally makes no sense but then it does. Its a strange satisfying and its annoying to hear people say its a walking simulator when people play 1000s of hours of games with farming and building fatories as the main aspect lol. 

Pros:
-game looks and sounds beautiful
-feels like a movie and a game had a child
-Soo much OCD goodness in setting up routes and theres actually progression in it
-story is fucking sweet
-Norman

Cons:
-literally will waste hours moving supplies to build roads
-anything before chapter 3 is a waste of time in respects to making any additional deliveries
- deliveries are a little generic in terms of dialogue and you rarely see the npcs you deliver to outside of their holograms which makes it feel really fallout 76 at times.
-You wont see flat ground until maybe chapter 4 
-driving over terrain is a hot mess

The things that draws this from being up there with the best are hackers in Multiplayer, they do not get banned and I always seem to run into them.

But other then that there is barely anything wrong with the game, campaign is one or maybe the best I have ever played, mulitplayer (Besides the hackers) is absolutaly fun

Zombies, even though Im terrible at it is fun and feels very clean and nice.

I have played MWR only a small bit because I can't get into a game of multiplayer and I havent finished the campaign at the moment because it feels clunky.

In conclusion, the only thing i find wrong with this game is hackers

904316,2870,X Rebirth,12610857,english,"DO NOT BUY THAT!!
If you want i sold you my copy!! Do not waste a money! 

I think that this game is big dissapointing for most of  supporters of all X - seria ! Relly do not waste money for that, but X3 Terran conflict or Albion even X2, all is better then this one!

I spent maybe 2000-3000 hours with all previous X games in total, so i think that i am not beginner, but this game ....


Graphics:
If you will play X3 game, you will see universe, nice planets, ships, nice nice nice - in touch with reality!

X- rebirth - yes there are a lot of ships, stations are much more bigger but that is all what i can say!

The whole graphics is more to close animation - comics - not to simulation. Really if you will compare previouse game, so you will see that X3 games were closer to photo reality that this game! 
The station are bigger and you must find their´s shops, to be able make business there, moreover, you must spend a lot of time to flight around big big station to get some discount, to be have hope for making succesfull deal!
Also menu was better, easier.
Y rebith looks like older game then X3 series, not like modern one year old game!

Trade:
No more trade empire, no more fun. In the game without scrips is trading very umpersonal, without interaction. 
Fully other system of trading no more fun for me.

It is very had to find goods, to know which goods id traded by station. If you can start with ecells in all previous X games forgot that ! No any more to make business with e-cells! I do not know, why they placed them into game! I so far after more then week of play this game do not find better offer then -16% (under basic price, and the best price to buy them was +5%, so you can realize only 21 % loss).


Travelling:
System of highways, gates is very boring very!

If you think that you will use a sector and galaxy map for navigation again like in all repvious game, also forget for that. Unable to select object in the map and select that as target - no way ! Really it is piece of .....

Autopilot is just for fun, not possible to use that, it is crashing into every piece of metal around the way, unble to avoid even station. What is that??


Fights:
I played all previous X games, and i never have so big problems with fight! 


GOLD MEDAL
Honestly i must say, that if you will play this game longer thne 2 days it will be big success, really!
From the same beginning it is boring, flustrating, difficult.

As i said i played all previouse X games, and i must that everytime it wasy the best game i played, but this is the biggest dissapointing for me!
I was looking forward onto next X game, and this is very very very bad!

Sad story :-((



If you want to buy, i give you my copy!

7ft long 1 hit spears that consist of scrolling forward and killing you at point blank range.
Getting killed the majority of the time while your enemy is facing in the opposite direction.
Chivalry dragging has crept back in and now you can NEVER predict the timing of any one certain weapon or weapon type they can either last a miller second for 2 solid seconds.
People will swing at your feet spamming q and dragging the mouse left to right then one hit your big toe.
The ranked gamemode is unplayable as it will almost always put you against someone way above your skill level and yes all the high levels abuse metas and have spears or rapiers in duels.
All the public gamemodes are the same just with very slight changes to the objective.
Every single time you attempt to attack an enemy in a server that isn't a duel server you will be struck in the back of the head and killed by a spear or a zweihander.

Although to my knowledge the developer left the game shortly after its release, it was also a 1 man team, and this is quite a strong game. I'm sure the brand-new at the time of writing steam workshop will only make it better.

This game is all about strategy, and learning by doing. I suggest you do not look up guides, at least not detailed ones, until you have played around a bit and can sustain ~200 person maps. You lose some of the magic if you learn all the math.

The game gives you access to every building right off the bat, but many won't be used until pretty deep in.  Don't think that just because it's available it's needed.

There are many ways to play this game, and the different setups might be the most fun. Do I want to make an uneducated mob? How about live in the mountains and sustain an educated populace on berries?

It's also one of the most brutal games I've played, finishing me off after hours of trying to save it from a single problem. Completely unforgiving.

I can't say enough good things about this game, it's worth it if you like simulation / strategy games. It's about even with Sim City for me, and thats a AAA release.

They do  come with helmets but none that are unique to the different hunters and you get some weapon skin packs. I played this game up until i could refund it and i can say i have already experienced the lack of invigorating story the first two had, Claptrap is...Claptrap and that may sound okay at first but it just seems like they copy and pasted him in with no changes, at least in 2 there was an interesting event that unfolds in this one...you just step off the bus and meet him? 

The meat and potatos;
The gunplay is great, everything is smooth and the weapons plentiful. The replay ability is there but if you do not play with friends i feel it may become too bland and uninspired after your first few hours. Characters return and conveniently after the Crimson Raiders had eliminated Jack and brought 'peace' to Pandora and while Lilith was looking for a Map they just go to the dumps and are eradicated? Im sorry i dont understand, the newly united superpower from 2 is just gone...hard to get behind. I love the sliding mechanic and the attachment to guns are great i will be looking forward to Borderlands 4 should it release on Steam in a timely manner. 

The base game is not worth $60, pick it up for $30 while you can or $40-$45 if you can. If you want to get even so much as a good deal when its not on sale you will be spending $100 to get the game and the Season Pass, without it you will miss out on a ton of content that was probably stripped right out to serve as a separate product. And if you were unlucky enough to get just Borderlands 3 getting all the content for a decent price (I.E getting the game and the pass for DLC) youll be looking at $90 to procure all the dlc for a good deal. 

I might repurchase Borderlands 3 base edition before it goes off sale, i will have to make the decision based on if my friends also get it.

4791135,640820,Pathfinder: Kingmaker,52892503,english,"Right now there are three big RPGs out there: 1) Pathfinder: Kingmaker, 2) Divinity Original Sin 2, and 3) Pillars of Eternity 2: Deadfire. How does Kingmaker fit? Here is a list of the pros and cons.

Pros:
1. Great character customization.  More races, classes, and subclasses than I've ever seen in a game. 
2. Tons of content for your dollar.  Usually I'm left wanting more but here I was often wondering how much more of the game there was until it ended. 
3. Good creature and level design.
4. Many awesome female characters and villains. 
5. Ruling a kingdom is great fun at first.  Decisions feel important and weighty at the beginning. 

Cons:
1. Not enough character portraits when creating a character.  You can import your own if you're willing to take the time but many of the default ones are mediocre at best.
2. Too much waiting! I've played almost 200 hours of this game and much of it was resting or marching my party back and forth across the map.  The former can be shortened by hitting space-bar during rest to skip the part banter. 
3. Bugs and bad design. My game crashed many times and when it did I always had to restart my entire computer. Some bosses were unfairly difficult and could hardly be touched even with a super buffed party.  Near the end of the game I had to switch to story mode because some bosses were so challenging they made me want to rage quit.  I got nearly all the way to the final boss and then a bug prevented the story from advancing. 
4. Ruling a kingdom eventually becomes a boring game of micromanagement that distracts from the games action.You'd do well to turn on kingdom development to auto after you get your fill.
5. The overarching story is mediocre in my opinion. 

Overall Pathfinder Kingmaker has better character creation than Pillars of Eternity 2 or Divinity Original Sin 2.  Divinity Original Sin 2 has better graphics and (in my opinion) a better story. I can't recommend Pathfinder at this time; I had heard it was bugged and waited quite a while to play it but it seems that it currently is still too buggy to play.",1561994660,1562007417,False,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,76561198012235300,528,32,11373,0,11364,1561993873

5231750,1190460,DEATH STRANDING,83588031,english,"I have just one complaint: the soundtrack is SO fucking epic, that I wish music tracks would trigger more often, and not just in certain situation when you, lets say ""reach a goal"". But hats off to Kojima for handpicking these tracks/bands and the moments in which to play them, I totally see why it's done the way it's done.
As for the real complaint: the ingame menus interface is simply not intuitive. It's not a tragedy, but it takes some getting used to.

Anyway - best game I've played in years! A true revelation for me - I was expecting to be disappointed. In the end, I haven't had so much fun exploring and discovering at my own pace since Subnautica.
Took me about 40h of gameplay just to find the common denominator through out the game that made the biggest impression on me: attention to detail. And I don't mean visual details, graphics.. I mean everything.
When you walk across uneven terrain, your char spreads his legs a bit in order to gain more balance while hopping forwards.
When you climb down a rope, around a tiny stone bump, if you tense the rope just right, it will wedge over that bumb which will in turn give you momentum that will push you and your cargo accordingly.
It is possible to have a separate audio source for sounds that come from BB (that baby in a tank) when it communicates with you, just to make it more immersive - I mean when have you ever heard of a game where it's possible to use 2 different audio sources? And it even makes sense.
Entire physics engine that takes care of walking and driving, and ragdoll interaction with objects and NPCs - too much to describe here but, like I said, a lot of details.
Jumping over anything is done amazingly! Try walking over a water stream/river that is too deep, you will be swept away in the most realistic manner. 
You can sit on a bike sideways, the regular way... but if you approach it from rear -> that is also covered with the appropriate animation.
Wanna unload hand carried luggae into a ""cargo space"" (avoiding spoilers here).. you can do it through the primary cargo managment interface just like anything else (which you will be using A LOT).. but in this particular situation it's enough to simply ""release"" the cargo from your hands (let go of the mouse button), if you are next to the ""cargo space"", and it will automatically be placed where it needs to be. It's small things like this that show you how it's one of those rare games that was released when it was actually finished! So this literally means you don't even have to click a button to perform an action.. you have to make ""half a click"" :)))

I won't go further into detail because it's almost impossible without spoilers. I don't want to reveal ""what is possible"" to future players, discovering everything is what makes this journey so worth it. At least to me.

Those people who keep saying it's a ""walking simulator"" and that it's boring because of too much walking? Total crap.
Ofc walking is a huge part of it.. but it's done in the perfect manner just like everything else. Every quest/route is just short enough not to become tedious or boring, and yet just long enough to make it interesting and intense, especially if there are ""bad guys"" in between. And as you play you constantly keep unlocking more and more new stuff and expand on the basic ""walking"" experience. So don't dare listening to anyone that has less than at least 20h of gameplay because they haven't seen shit yet. Even me with my 40h at the moment is honestly not enoguh to make a proper review.

Just buy the game and play it.. don't bother reading too much about it. It's not neccessary. The game is fantastic, and you only won't enjoy it if your head is pre-filled with negative trash from simple minded idiots who can't enjoy a good game.",1609354829,1609395013,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198007846600,109,4,6789,3484,2499,1610787586

The game play is extremely difficult even on the default start. But with great risks come great rewards.
In the 30 hours I put in, I have lost almost every battle that my characters engaged in so far. But every loss makes them stronger and tougher since they gain experience by taking damage. My aim is to keep all of them alive, I don't care if I lose the battle.
One strategy I like to do is make the city guards kill my enemies by luring them close to the city. After they are dead, I loot their bodies and keep the good equipment and sell the rest.
One faction that that strategy does not work on is the Black Dragons. They sent a war party of 30 elite to my base of six veteran warriors. I thought I could make them detour from their current path (you get a notification on screen when an enemy is moving toward your base. You can follow their movements in real-time on the map). I sent one of my fastest warriors in a preemptive strike to try to get them to follow him. He shot a shot a few with a crossbow but they did not deviate. He charged them from behind, that made half of them turn around and fight, but running away is difficult when you are outnumbered and surrounded by at least 5 warriors with superior equipment and training. My guy got cut down in less than 5 seconds but unconscious. They just caught up with the rest and continued. I had to send my second fastest runner to heal the first one.
After that I realized I could not fight them as I was, so I ordered my squad to wait it out in a nearby town while they ransacked my base.
Not to worry, the buildings will still stand and my squad is alive, I will get them back for that later when I can match their strength and numbers.

As the game is right now is how I want it to stay. A few things that I think could make combat easier for the player to control would be some squad command buttons and individual command buttons (or the same buttons but it depends on how many are selected). Something that gives them orders to retreat from a fight, because I keep clicking an area away from the fight but the character takes too long to obey. Or there should be a technique they can train that allows them to perform a maneuver to get out of the brawl when the player orders a retreat. It shouldn't be known at the start but learned, is my thought. Either from a training dummy or a skill learned after several lost fights.",1529345386,1529345386,True,2,0,0.525179862976074,0,True,False,True,76561198124890100,274,2,10600,0,3903,1549134982

4410180,227300,Euro Truck Simulator 2,28730968,english,"With so many early access games available these days it's nice to find a game which is actually finished. 

Euro Truck Sim 2 was an impulse buy, but it didn't take me very long to realise that I'd got lucky and had found a great game.

As a simulator it's great. You need to know the basic road rules but you don't get bogged down spending lots of time stuck on inane tasks. 

It has a lot of options for how realistic you want your gameplay to be too. You can choose the type of gearbox, whether auto or manual, and there's a further couple of modes for the choice of automatic or manual gear change modes. 

The career is also full of options. Early on you start out drving other people's vehicles, but you get a choice for whether you want to just slog it out and keep doing jobs until you can afford to buy your own vehicle, or you can borrow money from the bank and purchase your first rig. 

When you do buy a truck there are plenty of customisation options available, some of which are practical and others which are aesthetic. But you do end up feeling like you've bought a vehicle with an element of personalisation. Of course, you can opt to just buy an off-the-shelf rig and save a little money.

So far, I haven't spent a huge amount of time in ETS2, but this is definitely a game which I find myself looking forward to playing. The jobs I've done are long enough to make you feel like you've spent a decent amount of time driving, but they're not overly long and tedious. But that could all change: I assume there's a sleeper cab on my truck for a reason.

I'm currently playing with a joystick which seems fine. There's enough control over the truck in all situations. But I definitely think my experience would benefit from having a proper steering wheel and pedals. 

If you're into fast action and explosions, this probably isn't the game for you. But if you like simulations with a strong element of strategically building up a business, I really recommend this game.

Harkening back to Baldur's Gate, this is one of the few games that really captures the feel of D&D or (cough) Pathfinder in a video game. No longer bugged plagued as it was originally, this game is amazingly indepth with hundreds of hours of content and replayability.

In fact, as of this review with 272 hours, I've only managed to complete about 1/3rd (I believe) or perhaps less of the entire game's main storyline.

Hundreds of hours of customization, replayability, and a fun campaign makes this a perfect game for any gamers looking for a true to heart RPGTabletop experience or seeking D&D/Pathfinder in a video game. (Also this game has mods <3, most enjoyable is the turn based mod to truly turn this into a D&D/Pathfinder game)

MODS--
Recommended mods in order to streamline portions of the game that some people will find tedious (such as myself). 

If you're fickle with your character choices and often reroll get the Respec mod.

If you dislike the kingdom management or feel stressed by it (me) get Kingdom Management.

If you like fashion (like me) get Visual Adjustments for better player control of appearances.

If you want traditional tabletop feel (sort of) or a slower paced game get Turnbased (works suprisingly well despite not being designed for game balance.",1561702820,1561902212,True,4,0,0.50276243686676,0,True,False,False,76561198026893700,482,10,19007,2,16382,1610567894

4886292,233860,Kenshi,43535321,english,"This game is a masterpeice. It is a *steal* at $20. It's a steal at twice the price. Assuming they fix some of the more annoying bugs (shadows are pretty terrible, and game does occasionally crash) it'd easily be worth a full AAA price of $60, in my opinion.

This game showed up in my steam queue one day and I - never having heard of it before - dismissed it within seconds after seeing it in Early Access still after initial release in 2013.

Later, and I don't even remember why at this point, I found myself watching some youtube videos of Kenshi gameplay. That was when I realized my mistake. After looking more into the ongoing active development I bought it right away.

And I am so very glad I did. :)

That said, even I have to admit it's not for everyone.

There are no quests. There is no ""main storyline"" to play through. There is no main bad guy. You're not special in any way whatsoever. It's literally just a world sim sandbox and you decide how you want your guy(s) to live their life in this world. You HAVE to enjoy coming up with your own ""quests""/goals.

One thing i wanted to highlight that i don't think gets pointed out enough in the reviews is the combat system. Animations improve with your characters' skill, and new types of attacks open up as well. At the start you fight like a bar-room brawler with no training, but as you skill up your character fights with much more competence and style.

Heavy weapons and polearms tend to get more AE attacks, and light weapons tend to get more single-target attacks, but there's a fair amount of overlap. Martial Arts (unarmed fighting) is particularly interesting, you start with basic punching and shin-kicking and evolve into a stance-holding matrix-dodging flying-kicking kung fu bruce lee badass. Ok, i know nothing whatsoever about martial arts IRL, but it's impressive to see your character evolve over time.

Pros:
-Once you're in game, there's no loading screens anywhere. Interiors/exteriors it's all one seemless world.
-The world is GIGANTIC, and 1/4 of it isn't even out yet, as of the time of this writing.
-Very immersive, easy to suspend your disbelief.
-Awesome combat system built around a *lot* of excellent animations, very satisfying to watch.
-Truely open sandbox, there's precious little you can't do (or have DONE to you...) with more capability coming from the devs (such as being able to truely take over territory - or aid allies in doing the same - and rewrite the geopolitical map).
-Supports just about any playstyle from lone wanderer (not recommended for newbs, though) to expansive empire-builder.
-If you get into the crafting and/or base building elements there's a lot that can be automated once you have the people to assign, it's a very nice system overall.
-Workshop support with a lot of excellent mods out there. In particular i recommend the Dark UI mod, or the Dark Vanilla UI mod if you want a less clean/modern look but still the same (much improved) color scheme as Dark UI. But ""Dark UI"" (not Dark Vanilla UI) makes text a LOT easier to read, i love it.

Cons:
-No loading screens, but the constant streaming of data as you move through terrain can result in serious FPS drop. This gets worse the faster you can move (high Athletics skill and Athletics-boosting prosthetics). *STRONGLY* advise installing this game to an SSD if you can, it helps a *LOT* (but still doesn't cure the issue).
-Occasional crashes, which is pretty frustrating. Only happened during gameplay twice for me so far in 80+ hours so not the end of the world. Quicksave often, and failing that there's Autosave to fall back on.
-Shadows are a buggy mess. Flickering, LoD issues, what appears to be vis issues in some areas where the shadows aren't calculated correctly. After trying for a while i just turned 'em off. Seems like the problems get worse the longer your session is, but maybe that's my imagination.
-Default UI is pretty ugly and text is blurry and hard to read. This is a super easy fix with the Dark UI mod in the workshop, but still, the UI the game ships with is unpleasent, imo.

I suck at it so far, I don't optimise very well but I am learning, my colony is shit but it's MINE. The story so far is pretty epic/sad/brutal. Basically I named one of the old ladies I started with ""Mum"" she is the character that kinda does everything pretty well, and now she is REALLY good at a lot because she is the only one that has survived the whole 20 hours this last colony has been around.

Kind of sad that all of her ""children"" have come and gone before her, she has buried 8 colonists so far, no Mum should have to endure such hardship.The funny thing, however, is that she has a serious case of Alzheimer's so she probably does not remember any of them, lol.

I nearly had A total party wipe of 4 colonists when a pack of animals wanted their revenge, Mum was bleeding to death, and went into a confused state , forgetting to tend to herself...Luckily the man in black came and managed to save her with 2 hours to live, the other 3 perished... The man in black, BTW, His name is Vladimir and he is a politician...I'm not making this shit up.

After Vlad saved Mum, he tended to her then proceeded to binge on the last of my smoke-weed joints...Honestly I couldn't be mad at him as he smoked up in my kitchen. Since then, a lone wanderer name ""Lawman"" joined us out of nowhere, and again, Mum lives on...she lost a  pinky toe though, I truly wonder what her fate and that of the colony is from here on..

Did not really mean to write all of this, just wanted to say ""Game Gud"" but this is the effect it has, when you look to create stories, it is fantastic at helping you do that.

Lastly out of all the colonists (8 or so) that have died so far there seems to be a marriage curse, half of them were couples (this also happened with my first colony). Every time a couple in my game gets engaged, either one gets kidnapped and the other dies, or they both die horribly before wedding day.

That's me. I'm done  

Never getting married / 10

Haha Just kidding, it's pretty similar to other card games.
But, what really makes a difference are the developers. They cater toward the community and take advice and critiques very well. Because of so, I am extremely excited to see how this game does on it's official release.

A couple of things you might want to consider before buying the game:
-Yes, it is ""another"" card game, but you have to understand that you are playing as one character and the card are actually the skills for your character. (For those of you who played Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories, the combat system of using different cards are similar, well I think they are haha)
-No, this is not Hearthstone OR Elder Scroll's: Legend.
-This game is a ""die and go back to the beginning"" type game (This will happen often if you are like me XD )
-Takes time to learn the different strategies.

Well, that is all I have, but the biggest take away is that the Developers are working to make this game better and that they cater toward us the Community.

The whole atmosphere in the game, from its narrative to the way how it expresses the story, how it let you feel  through your character, how you accept an hour long traversing the mountains, which is not making you bored but rather curious what new horizons you will see IS ABSOLUTELY STUNNING. From this perspective, this game is unbelievably original and its own kind of experience. This experience was finally the reason to finish the game.

---

The negatives.
AMERICA FIRST. Why the he11 the whole story is about absurd American exceptionalism? Time to time the characters talk about the world but the whole story is that the ""world"" you have to save is actually America. It's boring and it's what is exactly not cool on America. 

YOU ARE A HERO. All the dialogues you have after all deliveries need to ensure you that you are absolutetly the best porter on this world. The NPCs are surprised in what condition you have delivered the cargo. Why? Do we really need to be ensured that we are the best all the time? It's annoying.

GUI. The game interface and its animations is so annoying that I had to close my eyes time to time. I had to go through unbelievable senseless statistics that have nothing to do with RPG-kind of a game. You need to see all the shining glowing graphics and texts with final statistics after delivery that have little sense for your progress through the game. In the end, everytime you take an order you cannot make the decision what equipment you want to take with your. E.g. you can't recycle in this moment, so you must finish this part of preparations and go back to the terminal. This is something every player must experienced but such a bug was kept in the game not by mistake but by game design.

TD;LR: I really like it but it's a game not for everyone. 

Anyways, the best way to describe Death Stranding is walking simulator with lore. I know that may not sound interesting at first but most things in the game are super super well done. It's an aquired taste kind of game, you may not like it all or you very well may love it. This review says yes so that means yeah I really like this game. 

Death Stranding is another almost masterpiece made by Kojima with his new studio. It's a game that doesn't fit any genres, calling it a ""Strand"" type game. It's a one of a kind experience. 

The game isn't about combat rather planning ahead for a long journey ahead of you, plotting routes, things to take with you on top of the deliveries you already need to make, rebuilding America while doing, and uncovering mysteries about the Death Stranding. All while walking point A to point B. 

Death Stranding does have combat however, I found it to be more tedious than anything. The boss fights with the BTs are boring throw gernade or shoot blood bullets, boom easy. The MULE camps are hard to stealth because there are so many people to take down without killing them. 

The story is complicated as all hell and I needed to turn to outside recources to fully understand it. I don't really like doing that for story driven games but I make an exception. The story is super weird and something you've never seen before, I guarantee - Yet, somehow it's a phenomenal story all about connections. The story is also emphasized more by the fantastic motion capture and voice acting as well, it's surprisingly very immersive. 

I would explain the plot however I don't want to go accidentally into spoiler territory and i'm still trying to figure out everything for myself. It's basically an apoclyptic world where people are too scared to go outside because of invisible monsters from the dead that you can't see so brave porters who deliver stuff like the protagonist, Sam Bridges come to be essential. 

From a technical standpoint with this port: A+. The issues I first had got patched where DLSS didn't work and I got stuttering while streaming but DLSS is integrated so well into the game you'll get a pleasant and smooth experience. 

If this sounds at all interesting to you, read some more reviews and no harm in at least trying it out! 

It's not a game for everyone but I thoroughly enjoyed my experience and I know this review is structured pretty badly but eh.",1595988136,1599105743,True,1,0,0.523809552192688,0,False,False,False,76561198176921000,144,43,2705,1,2702,1610672616

2150541,381210,Dead by Daylight,23559538,english,"My reccomendation for playing this game is to stop around rank 15 and put it down until season restart. It's fun, but the asshole meta that the game itself encourages at later ranks kills all enjoyment.

I can only speak from the perspective of the killer as my main, but past rank fifteen, expect survivors to teabag you, body block you, swarm you when carrying people to hooks in an attempt to slow you, blind you with kitted out torches that send your screen white for five seconds straight and never run out, bum rush hooks to save their freinds as quickly as possible so they can sprint burst away, decisive strike you everytime you pick them up (a perk that allows a free escape from the killer, which -always- feels so fun after the work you put in to chase them down) - and much more scumbaggery that's completely antithetical to the idea of the theme driving the game: survivors fearing the killer.

It's not necessarily impossible to counter all of this, it's simply not fun. I'm still ending most games with 3+ survivor kills but there's no enjoyment at all in being rushed down and hampered by survivors who don't concern themselves with stealth or tactics beyond what i've listed above. And why should they? The game doesn't reward you at all in terms of bloodpoints (the rescource for the ranking system) for a slow and carefull approach - i'm not tilted so much by the players doing these things, there's no secret code of honor and players -should- do what the game encourages, more that the game has allowed itself to go on in this state for so long now despite the constant feedback from the community complaining about all these issues.

tl;dr : It's fun initially and it really is something special when a good game happens, but when the meta kicks in at later ranks, expect those games to be few and far between.

Also, why doesn't the killer just fucking close his eyes?",1465939858,1523203481,False,1,0,0.523809552192688,0,True,False,False,76561198032203800,473,11,8488,8,2732,1610203604

i have played this game for nearly 20 hours and streamed about 90% of it. This is the first rhythm game that i've ever bought for myself as i don't have much talent in that department. the sabers sold me, i gave it a shot and have been having a CRAZY FUN time ever since. i got fairly decent at most songs on the hard mode, can complete a few songs on expert but even when i fail, i always feel like a champion because of the amount of fun i am having. 

the game itself is a workout, even just while just playing for fun. the songs are excellent and i am not tired of hearing the same 10 songs yet, myself. there's a standard mode, a no arrows mode that i like to refer to as a free-style mode and a party mode. 

the arrows mode on hard is my comfort zone for a good time playing this game and i am perfectly happy with that. over the past few days i have been experimenting with the dual bladed saber staff similar to that wielded by Darth Maul and it has made the game a brand new experience with completely new challenges and different ways to have fun! the community of fans of the game have already begun making mods to add to the longevity of the game for themselves and the devs seem VERY active in continuing to improve the quality of the experince in Beat Saber. i think it's amazing that so much fun can be had in such a small game.",1525799438,1525799438,True,1,0,0.523809552192688,0,True,False,True,76561198353002900,111,16,15922,40,1283,1610230815

2336330,264710,Subnautica,63463112,english,"TL;DR: Great game for sandbox survival fans, even at full price. Some bugs degrade but do not ruin the experience. 9/10

First and foremost, Subnautica is a really great game. If you like games where you explore, harvest resources, and build bases, this game is for you. The story is fairly good as well, but some of the most interesting content in the game comes from finding abandoned PDAs. That being said, if you miss one you may be missing out on a huge part of what helps this game immerse you. One thing that this game does really well is the visuals. It's honestly amazing coming from an indy dev. Additionally, from the moment you touch down in game, there's an air of anxiety and horror in the sense that you don't know what's waiting for you in the deepest reaches of the ocean.

That all being said, there's some bad with the good. This game is a buggy mess even years after its official release. Honestly though, it's within acceptable ranges given the amount of people that put up with the AAA titles that are still buggy as all hell like Bethesda's games. Some elements of the game were also implemented fairly poorly causing certain parts to become more frustrating than fun. For instance, the last quarter of the game is literally one big fetch quest. You travel to and from places multiple times and really the only way to avoid it is to look up a guide of the items you need, but honestly that ruins fun of it all.",1581647155,1587996734,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198067662500,202,30,4833,0,4769,1588302133

5816314,413150,Stardew Valley,28859722,english,"Let's start this off with a little background: it's December 31, 2016. I'm a High School student currently taking all Honors courses which has really stressed me out. This is one of the first reviews I've ever written.

When I first heard of this game from a small Youtuber named paulsoaresjr, it looked intruging. Games like these catch my eye, which is quite unusual, as my primary tastes lie in games such as XCOM 2 and Battlefield 1. So I bought it for Christmas. It.. may have been the best purchase of 2016 for me. You look at my other major 'best"" purchase of 2016, XCOM 2, and you are comparing 213 hours... to 93. IN 5 DAYS. At that pace, all I need is 6 more days, and I have basically caught up with XCOM. This game has been the best way to end 2016 for me, which wasn't a particularly good year for me. I've never felt this good in awhile. I have realized some things about my life from the game I wish I would have realized ealier in the year. For the first 3 nights, I stayed up until 3 in the morning playing, which is unusual, because I have trouble staying up past 11:30 recently. This game has helped me pull away from the reality of life, which as I said, hasn't been the best. Enough of me though, you want to know the game stuff!

PROS:
-Simplistic
-Developed by one person (which is pretty impressive)
-Runs smooth, have not run into any glitches aside from minor graphical ones
-Developer continues to work on and improve the game
-AWESOME soundtrack (If anybody happens to know the EPCOT music played around Innovations, a particular summer theme heavily reminds me of it)
-Plenty to do in the first year

CONS:
-Developed by one person (huh? Yes it is also a con, as he can only do so much work)
-Starts to get a bit repetitive around the end of the second year (EDIT 1/4/17: This isn't as severe as I realized, I just had taken it a bit too fast. I still enjoy it and can easily nail 2-3 hours per day on it)
-NPCs use mostly the same conversations/say things they have said already (which isn't terrible, but sometimes it gets a little bland)
-From what I've seen and read, children don't do much besides becoming a new set of conversations for your spouse and a new relationship to build (I want my children to toil in the fields with me!)

All in all, I highly recommend this game. Only 5 days, and it's done great things for me. It may not be for everyone, but if you are on the fence, buy it. Stardew Valley has a nice charm to it. A simple life, when things in the modern world today is so interconnected and quite crazy. It's one of my best purchases. Ever.

28223,292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,81045210,english,"The scope of the game is incredible. The amount of true unique content on display is ridiculous. Most side quests here get more attention to detail than main quests in other games. Emptying a chamber pot for someone in Witcher 3 would get you a full voiced cutscene and a chase sequence. If there is one consistent flaw with the Witcher 3, it would be that the parts are stronger than the whole. It's side quests, and especially the excellent DLC releases, are in many ways better stories than the main arc.
There are moments atop a mountain when you can happily leave Geralt poised, listen to the excellent jingle-jangle lute-based soundtrack, and watch the time and weather change - typically resulting in a brewing storm and rain. Need to shift forward in time, then simply meditate to restore energy and potions, or grab a bit more sunlight.
Some of the small things stand out in particular: the way the wind catches the trees, how sunlight breaks through the branches as a forest thins out, the flow of characters' hair, even wet skin after a bath. Of course there's better to be had out there, because the gaming world moves fast, and five years is a long time in any game's life.
Its shockingly cohesive world is as beautiful as it is demanding, and it's packed full of mature content that throws you from one emotional response to the next.

India has a leader that's not just Ghandi, yay finally
City states seem alot better than Civ 5
deplomacy feels more realistic with the new system when someone denouces you it doesn't create a chain effect of everyone denoucing you like in Civ 5
scenarios I like em, not too long and complicated, honestly barely touch the Civ 5 scenarios, and brilliant that you can do them on multiplayer aswell as having the option to have mods on in multiplayer matches
...
Path finding is terrible bascially dont trust your units to move on their own they will just get stuck or take the longest  way possible and die in the process.
The true start location maps are unbalanced;
Europe: Georgia has a huge advantage, 1/4 of the map is basically empty England starts on a natural wonder, brilliant except the ai doesn't know how to handle it 
East Asia: Scythia has a disadvantage with there being a lot of mountains, almost isolated.
Earth: Rome, Greece, Macedon are too close together, Europe is much smaller, japan is only a few tiles yet America got bigger? To be honest I just get the mod set ""YNAMP"" for True Start Location maps on the steam workshop

Ai are dumber than in civ 5? Declare war with no army, denounces you 1 turn and praises you the next, Australian AI tries Domination yet hates war?  ai still settle weirdly, eg: ai settles 21 tiles away from own it's own capital and  so became independent in 5 turns...

Pantheons strategically there's a lot that are terrible and only a few that are great, beliefs are confusing and I didn't know you could only have only 1 of each type, whilst the only way to know this is to check the help as they aren't organised the same way (so this took a while) 

Some of my mates and I who play Civ 5 fell like the devs don't care about balancing for the multiplayer aspect but instead just add more stuff, more ai, more OP abilities, don't get me wrong I like some of the addons but it's a bit complicating , ai still suck, the ""difficulty"" setting should be renamed to ""handicap"" setting... (same for civ 5)

EDIT ... newest expansion wow, trade system is broken and revamped tech & civics. Seems like they haven't quiet realised fixing something doesn't mean keep adding to it.

last edit: stop bringing out DLCs, balance first? no... owell guess I'll stay to watch the chaos

Good if you like horror
Procedurally generated
Co-optional gameplay

Peer-to-peer server (Survivors connect to the killer)

1733955,8930,Sid Meier's Civilization V,4018855,english,"My late, and final verdict. Like Civ 4, Civ 5 became a complete experience with all the expansions. AI battles really didnt become exciting until the very last patches. But when all the expansions were there it became a great civ-game...with all the flaws you are used to if you have played this series since it started in the early 90´s. What the complete Civ 5 failed to achieve was interesting diplomacy, leaders with really unique personalities, proactive AI (you can play an entire deity game with only 3-4 cities and no one will attack you, even though they have literally hundreds of units just ready to be used) and many more things that would have made the game more immersive. One could also wish for a less linear system when it comes to research and social policies. But with the obscene amount of hours played, i clearly loved Civ 5:)

Now when we all know about Civ6 coming in october, lets keep our fingers crossed that they will bring better immersion and basically more fun into the game. The last expansion to Civ5 brought, for the first time in the Civ series, a good late game. I would like to see more things that makes the entire gameplay, from start to finish, more fun and immersive....and all the stuff i said that Civ5 failed to deliver. And lastly i want a better turnbased multiplayer experience, because that is something that has never existed in the Civ series. That would open up an entire new feature in the game, because lets face it: the overwhelming majority of us havent felt that much love for multiplay in this game.",1304420425,1464777388,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198030791400,131,15,272764,0,270147,1545463343
2017670,381210,Dead by Daylight,44133184,english,"Ok. Here is my in-depth analysis of Dead by Daylight. I have about 2,000+ hours as of right now and I play both sides and I would like to describe my full experience playing this game, start to finish.

The first time I heard of this game was, ironically, a Jacksepticeye video (i know). I thought the game looked awesome, but that was in 2016. I had only Nintendo consoles only and Dead by Daylight was only on PC at the time. However, in late 2016 I got an X-Box, and then in 2017 when DBD launched on consoles, I played a free weekend with my friend. And I LOVED THE SHIT OUT OF IT. I played it non-stop that weekend and was heartbroken when it ended. The fun that I had seen only from Jack and his friends was finally in my grasp; and it was just as great as I imagined it would be. The chaos when you're screaming when you first pallet slam the killer, or you kobe for the first time and escape. When Myers jumpscares you from around the corner and you scream like a little girl. However, after the free weekend, I forgot about the game. It fell into the past...

Flash forward to March 2018, I have a computer. Granted, a pretty shit computer, but one nonetheless. I'm sitting in discord browsing Steam, looking for something to play, and I see Dead by Daylight and my friend who is in discord with me announces he had has Dbd for a long time and loved it. In that moment, the great memories flooded back to me, and I without second thought bought the game. A lot of new killer had come out since 2017, which was weird but I was excited to learn how to play against them. My friend was like a god compared to me. I died all the time when I started, but that drive to get as good as my friend pushed me. No, not as good as my friend: Better. I wanted to be the best Dead by Daylight player in the world.

The next few months were a blur. I started to stop performing well at school. I would get home and all I would to is play Dead by Daylight from 4 to midnight every night for months. My skill increased, and so did my knowledge. In May I started to watch No0b3 more regularly, which increased my skill. In July I had finally mastered the 360. I had become a walnut to this game. No scare would even make me jump. However, one gamemode I had never touched was killer. I occasionally touched it, but for the most part I played survivor. But there was no way I could master survivor and not be somewhat good at killer. There was a night in June where I just sat down and played killer, and in that moment I had found my new calling. No longer was I just a survivor main. I was now... both. Survivor in itself is always a rush. Killer is hit or miss. Either you feel immense fucking pain our you can feel like a killing machine. It can go either way. Another thing that pushed killer gameplay for me was the rank achievements on steam. No way i could be a Dbd pro and not have all the achievements. So I had to start practicing and in May and June I mained Myers for the most part. I had a moment where I mained doctor for bloodpoints, but that was short lived. However, when 2.1.0 dropped and Hag got a buff. I had found a new favorite. No killer was like Hag to me. And ever since then I have been a Hag main. 

Now I'll cover the DLC and patches and how they turned me on or off form the game. 

I believe the game was most blanced in 2.1.0, however my personal favorite was 1.9.4 since that's when I started. While vacuum pallets was a skill I ever utilized since I was still a baby, I know how other people felt about them. The feel was just so...nice. It felt rich. Nothing will ever top that in my mind.

Once 2.0.0 dropped, I moved a way from the game a bit because the new pallets took a learning curve, as well as the new killer. But playing the game while a new killer was announced for the first time was really exciting. However I came back after a while and came back harder for 2.1.0 and throughout the rest of the summer. The spirit was fun at first, but in the end on her final nerf it turned me off a little, but I still played pretty much every day. Legion killed this game for me, I played nothing of the Winter Solstice and January. I came back in the end of January and I was probably playing the second most ever this Febuary. March, this month, has been great. I'm excited for dedicated servers, Plague looks really good so far, and I'm excited for the future of this game.

Final thing to take away from this game: It is beyond worth the 20 dollar price tag. Hell, even with all the DLC it still not even coming close to this game's worth to me. There is so much content in this game. The grind is long as hell but not incredibly unforgiving. You're hooked at the start, and the drive to increase you're skill is what pushes you further into addiction. Its replayable and constantly getting new content. The bugs and unbalanced nature doesn't affect it too much, but I feel one big bug fixing update would be greatly appreciated instead of other things. 

it is a great, but flawed game. Buy it now.

5848040,413150,Stardew Valley,21978258,english,"I wrote a review for this game earlier and it was far too jokey.

Stardew Valley came to me at a weird time in my life. My grandpa passed away last June, and my dog left us last December. I also quit my job last December, stupidly, trying my hardest to get by on selling my music, and I've been struggling with death anxiety for a while now, trying to find a point in life, to the point of even breaking down in more than a few anxiety attacks, which have singlehandedly been the scariest thing I've ever experienced.

So I see a few of my friends playing this game and fondly recall all the hours I've put into Harvest Moon games in the past and decide to give it a shot. I don't really know what I was expecting. Definitely not to find any answers, nor to find something worthwhile, maybe just a distraction from the existential dread hanging over my shoulders. But Stardew gave me more than that.

Maybe it was something I would have come to eventually, but I believe Stardew really helped me out. Something calm and relaxing. Something I can play for hours and hours and not have to worry quite so much. Something to help me breathe. I've described it to other friends as ""like Harvest Moon but better"", but I don't really think that's fair. It IS very similar to Harvest Moon, yes, but there's absolutely no rush, no reason to worry, nothing to fear. If you don't get it right the first time, there'll always be tomorrow. Maybe you won't perform exceptionally at the start, but you'll eventually get the hang of things. You just have to keep trying. You just have to keep putting in the effort. You can't get hung up on mistakes, but rather, you have to keep pushing forward.

I'm still trying to pick myself up off the ground. It's hard, but I'm still trying. I'm learning every day how to better handle things. And as corny as it sounds, I owe a bit of that to Stardew Valley.

If you're struggling like I am, please, give Stardew Valley a shot. It won't fix things, but it's a nice place to relax and it's got more than a few lessons to be learned.",1458631881,1458631881,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198036824800,273,1,16759,5,7516,1610941199

I figured out how to make water from a bladderfish on my own on the first start attempt. I did a lot wrong. Couldn't find more bladderfish, Die of thirst. No problem, I expect that kind of thing in a game like this. On the second and third start I found exactly one bladderfish between them. Looked up other ways to make water. The only one that seemed viable in the early game was to use coral and salt. I had to look up how to harvest coral. I had to look up how to find the rubber to make a knife so I could harvest coral. (rubber knife?)  Then it was time to look for salt. Advice online = it is everywhere. My experience = the game has no such thing as salt. Have not ever seen salt in my entire attempt to play the game.

4848808,899440,GOD EATER 3,51299836,english,"Ugh. This is a neutral review.

It is a nice game, but it feels like someone made an anime, then transitioned it into game engine, then padded it with battles at every 2 minutes mark - battles you ahve to beat so you can continue watching.

In this game there's significant discrepancy between production values in cutscenes and the movies and actual gameplay.

Character editors are nice, there are nice maps as well, but EVERYTHING is heavily reused, and you'll see the same time dozens of times, over and over again. Same applies to enemies, there are reskins, retextures, there are a lot of similarities and so on. At the same time every cutscene is voiced, and apparently plenty of them used mocap (or animators were very talented). This doesn't qutie make much sense to me.

The amount of missions you have to complete is quite large, but they're similar, they're mostly filler that you have to beat in order to continue watching the story. Typically the game introduces a monster, then several chapters later you'll see its reskin, then it'll be on another map, then it'll be paired with another monster, and so on. It is kinda similar to Monster Hunter World, but Monster Hunter World had gorgeous environments which were huge and open for exploration. In this case environments are nice, but they're heavily reused, and nobody really lets you ever explore anything.

I found combat to be quite dull, although there's a great degree of optimization, customization, tons of apperances for your character and multiplayer. 

I barely managed to beat the game, not because it is hard, but because after several dozens missions tedium caused by repetition becomes nearly unberable.

Still, the ending wasn't bad.

So there you have it.

A fairly odd game, that feels like an anime with combat engine bolted onto it for some reason. If you're interested in story line, you'll have to grind through the annoyingly similar story missions to see the rest of the content, which is definitely not for everyone.

3066282,577800,NBA 2K18,42605366,english,"Now I might be jumping the gun a bit here as I'm reviewing this slightly before finishing my 1st full season in Career. Finished the 82 regular game season but still in Play-offs but I think i've played enough of the game at this point to comment. Which I'll be doing about the Career, GM mode and MyLeague as the rest I don't care about and therefore haven't touched.

Overall, the career mode is a step up in my opinion over last year's game. Some people may prefer doing the whole college thing and then going into the draft not knowing which team you'll be on for the first season, and I'll admit I do miss the draft process (not the college part). But 2k18 gives you the choice to join any team at the start. Giving you the choice of joining an already good team if you want a good chance at play-off success, your favourite team or a bad team and trying to drag them to a decent season. Beyond the inital start, you'll met a variety of different characters from your best friend, to your agent, the Vet player who takes you under his wing (same person regardless of team), brand agents etc. Most of these characters I have enjoyed meeting and the interactions you'll have with them. Although you can't trade yourself to a another team like last year's game, you do notice that teams do trade with one another. So its possible that you'll see new players on your team part-way through the season and new players on other teams as well.

But the career isn't without its down sides. You can't ask to get traded to a different team, but you do choose which team you do start on to off-set this. Contract negotiations often feel quite pointless. You get an offer, you decide a part of the offer isn't good enough and ask for a better deal on that part and a few games later you get a completely new contract. Not just on what you asked on, but everything else as well meaning it was pointless to ask to get a bit of a better deal on just the 1 thing. The whole street neighbour thing for the career mode is a good idea, but why does it have to be online and get filled with other players? Makes no sense for a single player element to have that. Plus you have loading time between any building you go in or out of as well. If the neighbour thing wasn't online you could have all of that load at once so you could easily walk in and out of different buildings without having to load them up everytime. Beyond that there are bugs as well. An example I'll give is that near the start of your career you'll get the chance to talk to all the different Shoe companies and get offers. But for me I ended up getting the same Shoe company cutscene 3 times out of 5. Even though I was already re-negotiating with them after the first time they sent an offer my way. Also had bugs during a match as well, such as an opposing player glitching/passing though my player to get to a rebound (and not going around my player), even though my player was between them and the ball but its very rare thing to happen.   

As for MyGM and MyLeague. To use a phrase from Top Gear ""Ambitious, but rubbish"" for the MyGM story mode. In 2k17 it was my favourite mode as you could start it up and sim the whole season time after time, and get to the fun part for me which was trades, Scouting and the Draft. As well as adding in fake/fantasy teams. This year you can't do that. I don't know why but they created a story for MyGM which means you can't do any of that. The story overall, isn't good. The cutscenes were often out of sequence with the events of the story. Meaning you be making a decision in a cutscene not knowing what it is about, as it comes too early while the story hasn't got to that part yet. Unless you happen to have played through the story once already. I don't know if the story continues beyond the first season of the GM mode because I lost my enthusium for the mode after doing the full first season with a couple of teams. The MyLeague mode is more along the lines of what MyGM mode was last year except you can control more than 1 team, and overturn decisions made like rule changes for the NBA, the All-Star city location etc. Some people may simply move over to this mode instead of the MyGM story, but looking to play as mulitple teams and being able to over-turn decisions isn't what I want to do. 

Overall, this is where Steam should have a 3rd button beyond just saying yes or no to recommending the game. Like buy on discount only. Since the game has a bit too many bugs for me to recommend and the MyGM story is bad in my opinion which took away my favourite thing from the 2k17 version. But the Career mode, even with minor bugs, is better than 2k17 to me. So I guess I can't recommend the game at full price, but I will if the game is on sale for at least 75% or better. Since I don't think you can get the longevity out of the 2k18 version more than the 2k17 version of the game. The career is the sole highlight of the game to me and I will say that I hope that 2k brings back the agent character in future games because I believe he is too good to not use in future games.

323454,292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,41511204,english,"So I've heard about the Witcher 3: Wild Hunt for years and when it finally came down to $19.99 I felt I had to grab it. After finally doing so within the first few hours and be playing it this is one of the most beautiful games I've ever seen in my entire life. I don't know if it's because I'm on a PC with just regular settings but oh my goodness from each blade of grass moving the way it does, to the clouds, the rays of the sun this game looks absolutely gorgeously perfect.

Cons: while the game is beautiful indeed there are some flaws with the combat system that I felt. I don't know if it's because I'm using a PlayStation 4 controller on a PC or not but the way they combat and design it's very specific but hard to remember. It does take a lot of getting used to in order to be able to fight efficiently. But once you get used to the battle system you see why the battle system is designed the way it was. So my main complaint is that it does have a high learning curve as far as the controls are concerned. Also there does seem to be at certain points and glitches which I've seen happen in this game a lot more than I would like to but that's probably based on due to the settings that I have currently for the game. Also the beginning story I feel kind of drags on is very very slow in the beginning. I've heard that it picks up in Act 2 but Act 1 seems to be very very slow

Pros: did I mention that this game looks beautiful LOL. The detail that they put in his game from the little creases in the belt that straps around his shoulders to the large fields I feel this game is way bigger than Skyrim. And as I play this game and realize that not only do you go to several places in their own area it's just the make and feel of it feels like it's way bigger like just for White Orchard alone feels like it's almost a third of the size of Skyrim and there are several areas that are this size or even bigger throughout the game. It makes me feel as if Bethesda could have put a lot more work into their games when playing The Witcher and you realize this is what an open-world rpg is really supposed to be. But this might be due to the fact that in Skyrim you can create your own characters but that's still doesn't excuse it when you look at the many different cites, details, settings, and armors that you can still create while playing The Witcher 3. Also the story is engaging I feel that I'm very invested in the story within the first 9 hours but then you so much content that this game can easily you can put over at least a hundred hours to 150 hours into.",1523824517,1523824517,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198828876000,26,4,2584,0,557,1605680200

I put in four hours and I really enjoyed the setting and characters, albeit everything was small.

A quick text review:
Pros:
1) more gameplay then other nearly released rollercoaster 3d games (ok so there is only one but hay, and yes i own both, will review the other on my channel later)
2) nice selection of content for a first alpha
3) awesome coaster designer, very easy to use and a lot of fun.
4) will mature into a good game with time (and tlc from the dev's)
5) stable enough to play...sort of
6) fun to play as is (isnt that one of the main things to look for in an early access?)
cons:
1) no autosave (really essential in a game that is not 100% stable)
2) a lot of customization options that should be a doddle for them to add are missing (wheres my £ symbol lol)
3) no feedback from dev's as to schedule of updates (or any feedback really)
4) some optimization issues (that is pretty common with early access but is a bad point none the less)

So i recommend the game? yes but only if you understand that its alpha/early access and has bugs, crashes, etc. See it as investing in a game down the line, a game that i have every hope will be very good and that you get to play as it matures (and with luck influence its development)

There are lots of options to tweak the experience, from richness of resources to enemy spawns.

[h1] Written Review [/h1]
You play as a squad of time-travelers tasked with the mission to stop humanity's demise. Earth is being attacked by giant alien bug creatures, and you pilot mechs to combat them.

The main gameplay objective is to maintain your ""Power Grid"" health. Bugs will constantly target buildings. Each successful hit will drain your Power Grid by one bar. Once it gets to zero, it's game over, and you will get very few chances to regenerate those bars throughout your playthrough, so it's very important to protect your buildings.

This forces you to play in very clever ways, sometimes even placing your mechs in front of projectiles to protect buildings from getting hit, since they will heal after every battle anyway.

The gameplay is turn-based. For every round, bugs will set up their attacks. Then it's your turn. All enemy attacks are telegraphed, and the game will show you exactly where all projectiles and such will land, allowing you to properly plan. You have infinite time to make your decision, which is good because you'll really need it.

A mechanic I find very interesting is that a lot of your attacks do not simply damage enemies, but also push them. This way, if a bug is about to attack a building, you can simply get a good angle and push them out of the way of the building. They will follow through with their previously planned attack, however it will be wherever you pushed them to, instead.

This allows you to sometimes get enemies to attack each other.

The game does a good job at keeping the game fresh, as well as multiple playthroughs. This is because the levels are randomly generated, and the enemies are varied. 

Each level will have optional missions that you definitely want to try accomplish, because you will need them to help your playthrough last. You'll be able to heal your power grid, or purchase upgrades for your mech depending on the optional mission.

Enemies also have unique skills, and behave differently with the environment, which keeps you on your toes.

There are a lot of small details that allow you to really plan your moves nicely. Such as special tiles like a forest, which if attacked will cause it to ignite. If any one steps on it will then catch fire. Your attacks can also throw enemies onto their friends, causing them to both be damaged.

If you fail your playthrough, the planet will be overrun by bugs and you are given the choice to choose one of your mech pilots to save. This will transport them back to the future, and then back again to the past on your next playthrough. This allows you to really make them powerful over playthroughs, however it's also more horrible if you get them killed.

Overall, although I've explained the basics, there are so many fun aspects to this game that can't properly be explained through text, so if you're interested I'd invite you to watch my video review at the top. 

It's a great game, that really captures that simple-to-learn-but-hard-to-master fun that FTL had. The music is also done by the same artist behind the FTL soundtrack, so it's still great. I highly recommend the game!",1519851316,1519851316,True,42,0,0.717390656471253,5,False,True,False,76561198028091000,3667,209,5067,0,879,1553646311

But game is not really addictive or fun playing with friends like usually have been.
Right now there is too much cons in order to recommend.
My biggest problem right now is pay2pay system. Once you buy a game and open free packs, there is not any other way to get cards - only buying it from store (Right now not even tradable). They could prevent this problem with some daily/weekly task where you could get [b] UNTRADABLE and NOT MARKETABLE [/b] cards.
Second problem is game is not fun and not very attractive for my friends to play together. Best thing about VALVE games was  playing games together and having fun with friends. Right now there is nothing to do.
Right now ARTIFACT looks like a game that only swipe other card game audience and not making new one.

TLDR;
- pay2pay
- can't get packs for just playing game
- it is not addictive
- not game for you & friends, like other Valve game",1543585252,1543585252,False,3,0,0.517681539058685,0,True,False,False,76561198025259200,454,4,3871,0,460,1585955000

5128595,814380,Sekiro™: Shadows Die Twice,54016979,english,"Good: 
-Best controls so far
-Best combat system so far (it's amazing!!)
-Bosses have consistent high quality
-Story is interesting and characters are really cool
-Very colourful by FromSoft's standards (which I like)
-Feels more open than older games (not fully open world or nothing but still nice)
-Music plays outside of boss battles
-Very streamlined (no potential levelling trouble, tutorial guy etc)
-Prosthetic tools are very reminiscent of zelda tools
-Finally a difficult final boss!!
-Eavesdropping is sick

Bad: 
-Maybe a bit short
-Not crazy replayable 
-Overworld music can get annoying 
-Boss music isn't very memorable (it is nice to listen to though)
-Story is more like a zelda than a dark souls, it's not that cryptic (but I dont hate that)
-No weapon variety (some people hate this, I dont though)
-No different outfits (made me a little sad)
-Some areas don't feel like they were used enough or were very small / linear (abandoned dungeon, poison swamp)
-Some areas are reused (outskirts like 3 times!!)
-Dragonrot is SO easy to bypass (it's so not that bad, doesnt even kill NPCs)
-Some of the prosthetic weapons are SO irrelevant youll never use them
-Terror is mental

Overall:

I really do still recommend this game to Dark souls fans, maybe more so Bloodborne fans, and definitely new people looking to play a souls game. Definitely start with this one as it is the most streamlined and probably the shortest :)

This game is a Kojima unchained. It's like Konami was the filter between some of the most crazy and over the top ideas - and we still got the events in the MGS titles. 

That's not to say that it's a bad thing - the story is deep, rich, and convoluted. You'll most likely visit a couple forums to see what people thought. It's unfair to say it's a fetch quest game or Euro Truck Simulator, it's more than that - but some of the basic ""mechanics"" are there.

You're always going to be deliverying things in this game. No matter what - that is the core. Whether it's a peaceful drive, a shit show with enemies or just ""terrorists"" trying to take your shit. That's the underlying gameplay. 

However, the terrain that you must navigate is pretty unforgiving. It makes the building/rebuilding element of the game much more of a relief of not having to travel such dangerous paths. I played on ""Hard"" and it wasn't too bad at all - I almost would recommend that difficulty level.

The menus system I see pop up in reviews all the time - it's not great but it's not a deal breaker in my opinion. Once you get the hang of it it's not too bad, there for sure could be some QOL improvements on the UI, but overall it's overblown in reviews in my opinion. 

Bottom Line - If you're a fan of Kojima like you would be a musician or director - you'll probably enjoy this game like I did in all the weirdness of Kojima. If you're on the fence and don't really know what a Kojima-flavored game is. You're going to probably not enjoy this as much.

3592023,311690,Enter the Gungeon,22299677,english,"Sometimes, a game comes along which completely turns a genre on its side, that changes the way you look at video games. Enter the Gungeon (PC, PS4) is not one of them, but it's a damned good game. In the game, you look for a gun that can kill a mysterious entity known as ""The Past"" by going into the titular Gungeon and shooting your way through birds, books, sorcerers, and anthropomorphic bullets with guns. To fight them, you use your trusty sidearm (which varies from character to character) but as most roguelikes go, you can find and unlock different guns. This is where the game gets interesting. All the guns are unique and fun to use, ranging from a M1911 to an exploding banana. As you progress, you unlock more guns to use in different games. You're not the only one with an arsenal; your enemies have plenty of guns, and will use them like crazy. You'll constantly find yourself being barraged by a swarm of bullets, which you can shield by flipping a table, dodge roll away from, or use a devastating Blank to get rid of. However, eventually, you WILL die. This game is hard as a rock, and twice as fun to throw at your buddies. Like most roguelikes, you lose your progress when you die, but you keep your unlockables. This is rewarding, because it makes you feel as if, even though you died, you made progress anyways. However, like all games, there are flaws. The soundtrack isn't stellar, and some of the characters are objectively better than others. However, these flaws don't detract from the fact that Enter the Gungeon is a great game, and I would recommend it to any hardcore gamer who want's a challenge.

3496141,250760,Shovel Knight: Treasure Trove,13213366,english,"disclosure: I am one of the many Kickstarter backers for Shovel Knight, at a low tier. I invested in what looked like a good concept at the time, but otherwise ignored it until publishing time. Here's my take on the fruits of the project:

Shovel Knight is a modern day ""de-make"" style platformer. With physics and maps that adhere strictly to their limitations, and a soundtrack that sounds just as at home on an old NES as on your PC. Aesthetically, the game absolutely succeeds in achieving the retro tone and feel it was going for.

Gameplay-wise is even more impressive. Shovel Knight delivers an *incredibly* solid 2D platforming experience, with good character art, and a nicely themed story to keep the pace moving. There are eight very unique feeling bosses that round out the world in Shovel Knight, each feeling very distinct from the others both in design and in their difficult and technique. Environments are also expertly designed, with just the right amount of difficulty to have you give it a few solid attempts before you could clear it. Special mention needs to be given to their penalty system. The lost money bags are a fantastic way to make the game only slightly penalize you for deaths, but enough that there is still a real risk in trying a tricky jump. This works to keep things tense while still feeling fair, and works mainly because of how balanced the in-game economy is. There is plenty of money to let you afford all the major upgrades in the game by the end.

The story is simple, but one I really enjoyed, as it was told with colorful characters and really good art to carry it along. The gameplay almost puts Megaman to shame with how fresh it feels.

Mowing through packs of demons with different tactics... Different guns... All but leaves a huge grin on my face when I slaughter these demons. The story is longer than the 2016 version, more interesting, more FUN! 

If you are like me - pushing the difficulty... You will have to really know your arsenal. Learn keybindings, learn weakpoints on your enemies, plan your runes to different encounters and missions. Even enemies. 

I like the platforming - but sometimes you will run around scracthing your head wondering where the F do I progress. 

All in all... depending on your will to explore to find collectives, you're looking at 50h of rip and tear. Plus any additional master levels you wish to do after you have completed campaign.

3600978,283640,Salt and Sanctuary,38689209,english,"Overall pretty good game, though some elements need touching up as they feel unrefined as of 1.0.0.7.

8/10

The game is very well done and very much Dark Souls esque, though the bosses are a bit more forgiving as you can warp out of the fight if you need to.

The combat is very well done, the majority of the bosses are fun, and the game does a good job at keeping a consistent feel and pace.

The rules are constant, there are very few creatures who have specialty rules to them, which contributes to the consistent pacing and it makes the gameplay much smoother (there is no creature that you have to arrow to death, or magic to death or whatever just for the sake of forcing the player to play that style).

The draw style is unique and effective, the armors look nice, the NPCs and Characters look different from eachother underneath the helmets anyways and overall it makes the game rather pretty.

what needs touching up:
-The tree of men boss is just terrible, he's not fun, he's not hard, he just has alot of HP and inconsistencies which make him a pain (I.E. when he hits 2/3rds hp he doesn't return your salt like every other boss before him does, sometimes his head and torso count as solid other times you can pass through them, when he stomps he seems to get a tad bit glitchy with his movements as his torso will become part of his gut and hips, it looks terribly done).  

-Some creatures can phase through walls which is just a pain, especially when they can attack while phasing through them (I.E. Fire skulls, clay men, the flying archers in the dome though they cant shoot through the walls which makes it seem more awkwards).

-Light armor is all just clothes, none of it provides any protection that is worth a damn, might as well run around with the tier 1 stuff on, it provides roughly the same amount of protection.

-Sometimes i would hold ""up"" and then jump which should be how to jump from a platform that you can fall through, and the character would fall through it even though i was holding up.

-Some of the smaller creatures seem to have way to much HP for thier size while other bigger creatures should have more HP for thier size  (I.E. Flaming skulls take more abuse then the chargers in the cage hallway level even though the charger guys are three times thier size and look like brutes while the skulls are litterlly just floating skulls on fire),",1514278303,1514278303,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,False,76561197998477500,822,32,3868,0,929,1596844950

Turns out they never did that because video games got stupid right around 2004 (you can infer fer yerself what exactly happened that year) and we ended up never getting the tradish D&D quest that all of us fanbois and fansquirrlz were lusting after.

2220583,289070,Sid Meier's Civilization VI,60118427,english,"It's surprising to think back and realise that I first dipped a toe into the first iteration of the Civilization universe some twenty-six years ago. Since then, the game has grown in complexity, scope, ambition and clearly in terms of visual effects and audio.

Civ VI is the latest release of the de facto empire building genre. The game shouldn't appeal on the scale that it does - yet so well-crafted is the presentation of the game, that newcomers along with veterans to the series can find their own space within it and progress how they see fit.

As such, Civ VI is one of those titles that occupies that rare talent for catering to the needs of the many - without alienating any group in particular. Players who have previously ignored such a game can pick it up in no time - whilst experienced players will actively search for the fresh nuances and capabilities within it.

There's a well-used phrase that perfectly sums up Civ VI - that of ""Just one more turn"". I've done that recently myself where a game started at 8.30pm, soon saw the clock reach 1.30am - without any obvious passing of time. It’s a time-sink - making you think of more elaborate plans to match your ever-expanding empire. It starts off with you casually clicking 'Next Turn' having kickstarted the building of a new granary and moving your singular warrior unit towards that unexplored section of the map. The game then processes the moves carried out by the other players and back you go to your own choices.

You send your warrior unit further into the unknown, the granary ticks off another small section of completion and now your advisors are requesting what should be researched next. Do you choose irrigation to further your farming, or maybe select animal husbandry to gain the benefits of retaining cattle? Of the several options that usually appear, an advisor preference is assigned to what they deem to be a priority. Such advice can be taken onboard and agreed with by the new player or completely ignored and overridden by seasoned players.

More events appear. You fend off the occasional barbarian scout unit and make contact with your first civilisation. Initial greetings soon grow into trading routes and the spread of religion. You might find that a desperately needed resource suddenly appears within a new stretch of land that you've just explored. Getting a builder unit over there is imperative - though now you've got several units and buildings in a build queue - and that builder will have to wait.

For the player, the game does an amazing job at containerising essential information turn after turn. It's difficult to let important updates to slip by, yet rather than bombard you with useless and repetitive feedback - Civ VI cherry-picks the most vital. Due to this, you never feel like the game is overwhelming you - rather it's a helping hand on events that could really do with your intervention.

Civ VI is not a swept board of accolades however. In purest core form, it's easy to feel that it lacks substance. The mechanics and structure are all there - but the content is thin on the ground and lacks variation. As is common these days, expansions and DLCs are seen as a method of extracting extra income from the players - often with mixed success. The expansions of Civ VI are not exactly cheap and added to the core game price itself, the overall cost can appear prohibitive. However, with the Rise and Fall expansion, you add the concept of loyalty, along with Great Ages and a new governor system. As expected, several new units, civilisations and wonders can also be built. The most recent add-on of Gathering Storm features Mother Nature getting her own back with erupting volcanoes, floods and tornados. A new World Congress that focuses on the leaders of each civilisation discussing and voting upon different matters - from applying bonuses to certain resources to sending aid for a struggling faction, can occur. Perhaps most topically relevant is the inclusion of climate change - which although influential, is far from the train-wreck that Civilization IV had when it featured the concept of pollution.

Civ VI is a superb heavyweight of a game - yet remarkably easy and friendly to get into. Being turn based, you get to take as long as you require to carry out your sequence of moves. I could argue that if played on a large screen like a TV, it would make for an involving game featuring the suggestions and input from several people sat on the sofa. You struggle to make a particularly bad decision, but by the same token, there's rarely a perfect choice either. Balancing the need to expand whilst consolidating and supporting your homeland is key to success within Civ VI. And as with nearly every option within the game - you can configure it to be as straight forward or ruthless as you like.

Overall and without wanting to sound like a sales pitch - I would highly recommend Civ VI in its Platinum Edition form. All the expansions and features crammed into the core engine make the title shine - enticing you in for that next turn that you told yourself you wouldn't have...... 32 minutes ago. Yet in standalone form, I'd be more wary of flying the flag for this game. It's not that it does anything wrong specifically - but compared to the rich content of the Platinum Edition, it feels like a hollow experience and mildly underwhelming. Therefore:-

The game itself is very immersive, you find yourself sneaking about a lot to avoid being detected by cannibals/mutants and to effectively hunt down your dinner.
The storyline is very immersive also, you slowly start to figure out what has happened and the lore of the game as you go along and find various items and documents throughout the game that point you in the right direction of what you are supposed to be doing. 
There is always something to do in The Forest so you are never bored and there is a lot of exploring to do.

Limited weapon selection

Insurgents have restricted weapons but operators don't. Plus, classes don't transfer between sides. If you are OCD about making sure your classes don't depend on which side you're on, you still need to modify 2 loadouts anytime you make a change to 1 class.

If you like collectible card games (CCGs) and Roguelikes, this is a no-brainer. It combines what makes those fun.

One thing I particularly enjoy is that I don't have the deckbuilding paralysis of a traditional CCG. Everything gets thrown out, win or loss, every hour or so, so I spend much less time in menus and more time playing the game.

Runs can get really samey at the beginning after you get a feel for the game, and I feel like it is simultaneously too easy and too difficult. I rarely have those ""well this is terrible luck but I can scrape through"" runs, instead most runs are EZ stomps, it's just a question of whether that's from my POV or the computer's.

The devs are tweaking and updating constantly - once a week to be exact. The new character has seriously spiced the game up and alleviated the ""Samey early run"" complaint, but that is of course temporary until we get used to the guy, and we can't expect there to be an unending flood of new characters. I would like to see starting decks be randomly drawn from a limited pool (of only the ""weaker"" cards) to keep it fresh.

It is worth noting that I have never experienced a bug that I noticed, and the game has more than enough content to justify the price. As far as Early Access goes, on a scale of Ark to Factorio, this is a Factorio situation.

Worth the asking price for its target audience, but if you aren't a fan of CCGs or roguelikes, it's hard for me to say if you will like it.",1527112882,1527112882,True,0,0,0,0,False,False,True,76561198009518200,437,1,2145,0,1181,1580090068

3057596,282560,RollerCoaster Tycoon World,22334174,english,"Loved RCT franchise and was so excited when I heards RCTW was coming out.  I am tisht and don't normally pre-order games and usually wait until they are in a good sale, however I preordered this as soon as I heard it was being developed.  I will say that I also bought Planet Coster too and have been playing the alpha of that.  I have no bias and I actually want to have two great theme park games.  I will continue to edit this as the game develops.

I've been playing theme park games for decades (yes, I am that old!!) and it's one of my favourite style of games.

The pre-realease weekend they did last year was a disaster and I was worried what game I would actually get for my money.  I anxiously waited for the next pre-release weekend until I saw that it was now released on ""Early Access"".   I guess they felt pressured to actually release something now that Planet Coaster was starting to do releases.

About the game.  The game does have a lot of features in it already to enable you  to actually build and manage a theme park.  This is definately in Early Access as there are issues that need to be addressed and features that need to be tweaked, but I have not experienced so many issues like other players.

Pros
Lots of feature to enable you to buld and manage the park.
A wide number of flat rides, coasters and shops to choose from.
The user content feature is amazing

Issues to be addressed (in my humble opinion)
Improved coaster building since pre-Early Access, but still is very fiddly and cumbersome to actually build a rollercoaster.  I'm sure with a lot of practice it will become easier, but even using the RCT like buttons to lay the track, it still isn't as easy and straight forward as RCT3.
Path building needs to be worked on
Needs the ability to demolish in a draggable area.  This maybe there, but I can't get it to work.  Its a pain in the ass to delete every tree and bush to be able to put a ride down.
It's not so clear the benefit of the different size staff buildings.  Is there a coverage radius that they cover?
I personally don't like being fored to have the entrances/exits fixed to the rides.

Should you buy this game?  I would still say yes.  I know there are problems with it, some people have experienced lag which I haven't.  I have faith that Atari are listiening to the community and will be implementing the changes, requests and fixes as the game develops.  Since release they have already done a couple of updates and I hope that they continue the pace and release frequent updates and changes rather than waiting months.

Yes, there are features in Planet Coaster that this game doesn't have and there's no arguing that the Planet Coaster videos look amazing.  Like I said earlier, I'd like to have two great rollercoaster games as I'm sure they'll both have their strengths and weaknesses.  Time will tell how both games will be developed.  For now, I will be spending far more time plating Roller Coaster Tycoon World than I will Planet Coaster.",1460274593,1460359188,True,4,0,0.524942636489868,0,False,False,True,76561198109720300,501,16,382,0,363,1471771631

The good: old first-person shooter game that accomplishes with not boring the player. Wide variety of weapons, pretty well dubbing (at least in Spanish), and easy to access and understand weapon menu and stuff. 
The plot is very interesting, now it is a cliche if we think of Stranger Things series for instance, but it is a cliche that hooks us, at least I find this stuff pretty interesting both in movies and series, and in videogames. 
The bad: even having chosen the easiest mode at the beginning of the game, I've been killed over and over again throughout the entire game, and I've had to reach many points and areas repeatedly unless I save the game constantly, thing that I did when I reached the final chapters of the game. It's not about the checkpoints what sort of annoys me or better said gets me done, but the fact of been killed that easily (taking apart that I may be a bit clumsy).
Finally, the controls are kinda clumsy or difficult, or that's my opinion. Though I know it's an old game. Quite many times I was bugged in the game, like, my character was bugged and I couldn't even move, so I would have to load the last checkpoint.

Additionally, somehow the enemies do not seem to attack like announced. If its a 1x5 or 5x1 attack, its just one 5 attack; or just one 10 attack, when it says 5x2 or 2x5; not always, but annoyingly often.
Also, if there is a 25% chance to wake an enemy, you _always_ wake the enemy, but when there ist a 25% chance to obtain a relic etc in the first of a series of attemps, you nearly _never_ get the relic with the first attempt. 
The description of the cards could be more precise, too. When it says ""chose one card"" it does not say ""from your hand"", but thats exactly what the card means.
And the last rant: at some point of the game, there are so many relics and effects active, that its _impossible_ to predict/ overlook the exact outcome of your or the enemy's actions, without studying every turn for minutes.

So, in the end this is a roguelike deck-building game for people who do not care about what roguelike and deck-building games are or how these games really work or are played.

PS: Addition: As stated by others, this is a RNG game, but the number(s) for your game is (are) rolled _before_ the game starts, not for each turn seperately. So, if the numbers are against you, you _CANNOT_ win a combat, no matter what you try.

4915450,552500,Warhammer: Vermintide 2,69801819,english,"The game designers did an impressive job of creating many classes that play uniquely and accommodate a wide range of stylistic preferences. There's not really a ""healer"" class, but there are certainly roles for tank, melee dps, ranged dps, support, and hybrids. The 13 maps from the base game are varied enough to keep the game interesting while playing through the scenarios. The crafting system, which at first seemed overly simplistic, actually turned out to be one of the most useful crafting mechanics in a game of this type. You can craft gear that is the equal of 98% of the gear you can receive from loot chests. Lots of opportunities for customization. The only downside of the game is the often hostile and toxic player base, but I guess that's inescapable in 2020. The game can be played very easily (and beaten) even in the hardest modes with AI bots filling out your party, although I recommend reading the very helpful bot guides in the Community section. Some of the AI behavior is not intuitive and requires a bit of adjustment on the part of the player, but nothing is insurmountable. The Keep (or home base) is unique to each player and can be built out and spruced up if you're into that sort of thing. If your an achievement hunter, the game has a robust reward system in place for those who enjoy such mechanics. After 350+ hours, and purchase of all the DLC, I'm extremely satisfied with the game, the quality, and my time invested. Gold medal.

5473804,1055540,A Short Hike,62388052,english,"This game is a lovely casual exploration experience, in the same vein as Untitled Goose Game or Costume Quest. It know exactly what it's hoping to provide, and it delivers in spades. I had always kept an eye on it, and now that it's on sale I decided to give it a try. 

I was absolutely not disappointed. The atmosphere and ambiance are adorable, and everything is cute, but not overly simplified. I found myself stopping to explore every possible nook and cranny I could find, and almost always stopped to chat with NPCs. The game is constantly rewarding you, giving you coins and shells to collect, and often letting you have quest items simply for talking to the world's characters. 

The main character, Claire, Is a nice enough person, and isn't written to be so ""nice"" that she comes across as generic or outwardly obnoxiously nice. Rather, she feels pleasant yet easygoing, and most interactions feel believable as a result.

Throughout the game, you direct Claire as she jumps, flaps, glides, dashes, and climbs her way up to the highest point of Hawk Peak on Hawk Peak Island on a quest for cellphone reception. Along the way you can stop to chat with and help NPCs. Or not. 

It's entirely optional to interact with all the NPCs, and you only really need to find about 6 collectibles (in the form of golden feathers) to climb your way up to the top. I would highly recommend talking to everyone you meet, however, as you can find many more items to help you on your journey by helping the island's other inhabitants. You can get an item to help you run faster, purchase more feathers, collect a few pieces of cosmetic headwear, and more, simply by talking to people. The map is small enough that you aren't likely to be lost for more than a minute or two, and the landscape is easy enough to learn your way around. 

If climbing the mountain has you beat, you can take a break from your quest and do various other activities, such as fishing, volleyball (but with sticks), running races, and treasure hunting, along with multiple short sidequests to help get various things for various people. Even though I was not required to do any of it, I ended up doing most all of it, and feeling pleased with just how much content there was.

The soundtrack is mostly comprised of a few orchestral pieces, but in my time playing it, I never felt any track was overused or overstayed its welcome. The mixing makes the instrument selection mix together quite well, and wouldn't be out of place on iTunes/Bandcamp/whatever the heck else is popular.

If all you want is a pleasant, relaxing little island adventure/exploration game on the cheap that fells great to play, and is equally pleasant to look at, you really can't go wrong with A Short Hike.",1579965137,1579965137,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198152416000,490,4,254,0,172,1580447849

Compound slowly expands over time, including steel buildings completely surrounded by a steel wall. We are invincible.

Get a distress call from an old woman running from some angry tribals. We save her and kill/capture the tribals (their bow and arrows are no match for our rifle and pistol). She joins us and becomes our charismatic chef.

Get another distress call from a big geologist. Prepare to fight tribals, instead put up against trained soldiers in nano armor and energy weapons. Find out that we are, in fact, not invincible. Hun is killed, Walsh is downed (but rescued by Young), and the old woman disappears without a trace (seriously no idea what happened to her, no corpse or anything).

We managed to down one of the soldiers. Young equipped his armor/weapon and killed a second soldier causing them all to flee. Walsh gets better and both he and Young are fully equipped in nano armor with energy weapons. Now we are definitely invincible.

Another group of tribals attack. They are pathetic and quickly killed outside the walls by my new energy weapons.

Wait, what is this? The energy weapons set the corpses on fire? Wow that fire is spreading quickly...

**5 minutes later**

The entire compound is lost and half the map burnt down before it finally started to rain. Apparently those weapons run on jet fuel because my steel walls and buildings were no match for that blaze. George W Bush would be proud. RIP trapped prisoners and that group of visitors from the other colony sleeping on my floor.

I guess sleeping on the floor in the ruins of the compound was bad for morale and the geologist we saved earlier snaps and starts stabbing Young. We put him down with energy weapons. Thank god there is nothing left to burn.

Young eventually snaps too and starts attacking her fiancee. She is downed but survives and is healed up by Walsh (thankfully he is a doctor).

Deciding that staying in the compound ruins is probably a bad idea, we move on to find some shelter elsewhere. What's this? Some kind of ancient structure? Well we have nothing to lose so maybe it will make a good temporary shelter.

Break through a spot in the wall, get attacked by giant bug robots. Run around the back and draw them out, then swing back around to enter the structure. Hah, stupid robots. There is something on the ground, looks like it does something to animals...maybe it will tame the ones nearby, I could really use the help.

Activate device, animals go into a man-killing rage. Every single animal on the map rushes to the structure. Young and Walsh go down in a literal blaze of glory as the swarms of animals attacking them are set on fire by the energy weapons.

10/10. Now I understand why the alien races in movies never trust humans with advanced technology.

I had the privilege to play the early version of this game way back in 2013, and while it was basic, the game was a fun ride with days’ worth of content. I can appreciate why the developer wanted to make a new exploration and leveling system to help make the game stand out, but the execution somehow makes it pointless to progress. No levels, gear becoming useless outside of the equivalent of your neighborhood, and items vanishing into thin air the moment you leave that neighborhood makes your progression hardly worth it. 

What’s the point of a game where your reward for hours of work is half of a percent total increase to your movement speed?

I lost interest in this game fast, which is funny because the game itself is very polished and well-tuned around its core system. (A broken system minds you,) but well-tuned regardless.

If I were to make a suggestion for the developer who won’t look at this reply because I hardly doubt, they would, I would make it so that as you explore new areas, your weapons lose their strength gradually. So, if you leave your area, your 5 Star loot might become a 4 Star, and so on. That way your progress isn’t too hampered by leaving to explore that neat ice biome. Another idea is to have, instead of the items like gliders or bells in special locations, lock those stat buffs across the land so that their small powers will lead to something. You can have those buffs be locked behind na enemy encounter or a boss fight, but if you want all of them you need to explore to different biomes because each area only has one key item. Lets say you start off in a grass land and you unlock the glider, ok cool, but now you have to find the bell for that one dungeon in the ice area to the north, or the whistle in the lava land down south. You get the idea.

I know there are countless other ways of improving the game but seeing as its been months since that point, I don’t think they will. I wouldn't recommend this game in its current state, only pick it up if its updated or if the reviews change.

But if they could just add XP back I would be a happy camper. God, I miss it so.

Just fucking buy it, it's like $5, and it's not even that big of a game. I got this game back in 2013 with my shit ass internet, and was able to download this game and that's when it was a whopping $15. But if you do decide to get this game make sure you get Counter-Strike: Source (CS:S). Trust me, it makes everything easier. But any who, lets get started.

First off the game is only like $5, if you don't have $5 then how the fuck did you afford to get a PC? It literally cost less that a Little Caesars Pizza.

Second you can literally do anything you want in this game, you can download anything, make it look like anything, and do whatever you want. If you want to be a fat fucking bumble bee blasting zombies with a sawed off with a x40 scope on it, by all means. If you want to building a giant building out of wood and set that son of a bitch on fire, by all means, if you want to race cars in this game, by all means. This game is like Minecraft after Minecraft. You can download addons (if you don't know what addons are for, just go to the Garry's Mod workshop and just look at everything to get an idea.) so for example you're looking for a particular map, BOOM in the workshop. If you're looking for a specific car, BOOM in the workshop. If you're looking for a unique playermodel, BOOM in the workshop. If you're looking for a type of gamemode to play, BOOM in the workshop. I don't get how by now you don't understand how that you can literally do whatever you want in this game.

Third you don't have to play online or multiplayer, you can just play by yourself if you're a lame ass introvert. This game is honestly perfect for anytype of player. If you want to play solo, sandbox is where it's at, if you want to play multiplayer, literally there's anything you want to play on there from StarWars RP (for all you nerds out there) and a bunch of other RP servers out there, there's Gun Game, Prop Hunt, Speed Runs, TTT, like I mean anything you want to play.

Fourth... honestly I've done said enough, just buy the game and quit being a broke bitch and spend the outrageous $5's and just try it, worst thing that could happen is that you don't like it, and if that's the case just sell your PC you uncultured swine.",1414981782,1608084827,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198088954700,75,23,42786,46,42740,1610766522

3139270,292730,Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare,26664011,english,"Everyone wants to hop on the hate train for this game without even playing it. I normally don't even write reviews, but due to all of the hate, I feel the need to. 

I'll start with the negatives. 

Cons - Low quality net code compared to other PC shooters. Games like Overwatch and BF1 outperform COD by a large margin. BUT, this game has BETTER net code than BO3, so keep that in mind. 

91 FPS cap. This doesn't particularly bother me, but there is no reason to make an FPS cap.

Occasional stuttering in Multiplayer matches. Happens maybe once every other game, where i get zero FPS for about a half second. 

People who aren't already into COD multiplayer probably won't like the COD multiplayer. The game keeps getting more complex and I don't think it is very inviting for new players. 

Okay, negatives aside, what are the Pros?

I have 700+ hours in the BO3 Multiplayer, and hundreds of more hours spread across other COD multiplayers, and i find this multiplayer to be particularly enjoyable so far. I went into the multiplayer with no enthusiasm, but after 20 hours of gameplay or so, i realized that i was genuinely enjoying the game. I think that the multiplayer is well balanced and well done overall. 

The creators of the Multiplayer probably had a lot of fun with the game, adding in a few classic weapons from MW2 and MW3 that look and feel just like their old versions. 

Optimization - For my PC personally, this game runs smoother than BO3 and AW. I have it on max settings at 60+ FPS, and i could not do that on the previous 2 CODs. The game looks graphically amazing, compared to the cartoony look of BO3. 

Zombies mode - SO MUCH FUN. I enjoy Trayarch zombies, but they always had a more serious tone, and with the way that the zombies maps were made, there was a lot of grinding involved to get set up. You ALWAYS had to spend 30 minutes to an hour watching youtube videos before you could even attempt to do well at all in a Treyarch zombies map. 

In the new zombies, it's so relaxed and fun. Everything is goofy and laid back. It isn't supposed to be taken seriously, and on top of that, it is probably one of the most fleshed out Zombies experiences i've ever had. There is so much more to do in this zombies mode than there ever was in any treyarch zombies, and it is all fun and easy to pick up on. 

The Campaign - I don't like playing COD campaigns. The last Campaign i enjoyed was World at War. The cinematic experience in that game was bar none. The last three Campaigns that i at least tried (BO2, Ghosts, and BO3) I ended up not finishing. 

IW's campaign, however, is an experience that drove me to finish it and pulled emotion out of me. And it was not the same linear experience that I was used to. It involved side missions and other decisions, giving it a never before seen felxability. That's all that i can say about it, you have to experience it first hand. 

TL;DR - If you liked BO3, get this game. It's a good one. It recieved a lot of hate for no reason other than falling into an unfortunate downward trend that the internet all got in on. 

Multiplayer - 8/10  (On par with BO3, with better net code/hit detection)

Zombies - 9/10  (I am a treyarch zombies nerd, and I actually enjoy this zombies more than treyarch zombies)

Campaign - 8/10  (This is coming from someone who generally HATES COD campaigns)",1479430914,1479430914,True,3,0,0.544854164123535,1,True,False,False,76561198022659800,106,7,7539,0,5876,1530921138

This world is absolutely massive, immersive and a perfect fit for the Metroid-vania genre. Hollow Knight is a 10/10. A masterpiece. From the tight controls, to the level design and music, there is nothing wrong about this game. It is worth far more than its $15 price tag. It is a work of passion and you can tell as soon as you load in. The sound track a perfect fit and so well orchestrated. The soundtrack coupled with the enviorment makes some of the best scenes I have ever seen in any one game. I found myself literally overwhelmed with beauty. This game doesn't hand-hold or give much direction in the form of actual instructions. You learn to play from playing the game. Fighting enemies is coordinated and tight, if you die it was your own mistake, nothing is ever felt cheap. You may come to a pass that you cannot get through, so you go to a different area and get stronger, get another power up and then you can do what you were originally trying to do. There is a ton of back-tracking and it is impossible to do an entire area in one run. That may turn some people off but that is a classic Metroid-vania staple. This game will have you begging for more if you manage to get to one of the many endings. I cannot recommend this game enough, it is well worth your money and your time.

My killer rank was 4 and Survivor rank was 2. My point in this is I know the game very well despite my hours on Steam not being very high.

This game has a lot of potential, but currently it is literally hot garbage. So the number 1 problem is how fast the objectives can be completed, for the longest time there was a perk that helped slow the objectives down making it at least managable for the killer. That perk is now nerfed into being useless, so there is absolutely no way to win as a killer unless you play as a few different characters (which wouldn't be as much of a problem if you didn't have to pay for all these killers that have almost no chance). What this effectively means is that if you play as killer and do everything right you're still probably going to lose, and if you play as Survivor and don't have a team full of morons, you're probably going to win. It's hot garbage and not in the least bit fun.

The problem is actually because the maps are so God awfully big, you can't properly pressure the objectives as a killer. People have done the math on this and it's physicially impossible unless the survivors just decide to not work on Generators. 

I uninstalled this game on my xbox and on PC, I won't be playing it anymore until they fix the objective speeds in some way (which really means making the maps smaller, NOT actually slowing down the gen speeds themselves).",1577165424,1578857363,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198083517400,56,7,1475,0,1160,1609544757

If you liked Doom 2016, you may or may not like Doom Eternal. It’s a different type of game built out of the same bits. Much more chaotic and much less focused. It’s Doom 2016 cranked up to 11, and not in a good way. 

They added a bunch of new mechanics but none of them do anything interesting.  Now you can press a button to get armor just like the way you can press a button to get health. You can punch things when your punch things meter is full. Certain enemies have weaknesses where you shoot a particular weapon at them or shoot them in a particular place, but exploiting those weaknesses ends up feeling like a chore. It all just ends up feeling pretty hollow.

The bad story in the first game was easy to ignore. The bad story in this game is so bad that I can’t help but be irritated any time anyone is talking. 

It’s still pretty fun sometimes, but it’s one of those games I sit down to play and an hour later I realize I’ve just been zoned out and bored for most of that time.

That’s just me though. I can see the appeal for people who aren’t me. It’s fast paced and challenging, and the act of shooting things is as much fun as ever. The guns are still great.

Nicalis is pretty shady, look into the other negative reviews.
They take good games, add a few broken extras, take over the IP (as it seems), try to put themselves on the front of everything, and then they shutdown decompilation projects.
Something not even Nintendo has done.

If you look at the achievements, not even 60% got to the first mandatory boss.

And maybe its just cause I'm playing Zane but to compensate for his new skill tree the others received a nerf which lost a good amount of damage (can't speak for the other characters). Now I respect and made my build work again (kinda) and while im farming for gear I'm also finding lots of anointed mods for the 4th skill tree that I do not own. So not only am I weaker but now I have a much lower chance at finding the gear I want with a good anointed mod. I was planning on buying the dlcs when I get back to work and have money but forcing players to buy the dlc by making it almost unplayable without it is insane. And yes I know you can still lay through but Borderlands is about the loot grind and being strong enough to grind it fast. That is now gone unless you pay for it.

I found the difficulty of the main game to be just right personally, not quite as unforgiving as some NES games due to checkpoints and being able to take more hits, but not pathetically easy like many modern games. One nice addition I found to the levels is the ability to destroy checkpoints, a simple 'higher risk/reward' mechanic. The level design takes similar ideas from Mega Man, with each stage having its own unique theme. The hazards, the boss and the stage item are all tied together with a general mechanic exclusive to the level. Some levels are more smartly designed than others, but are all overall well crafted. All of these are nicely complimented with great, tight controls.

The length of the main game isn't too long, probably stretching a bit longer than a typical Mega Man game. That said, with New Game Plus, and achievements which promotes other ways of playing (speed runs, no death runs, etc), there's a ton of replayability to be found in Shovel Knight.

The game has a decent mixture of chiptunes, some being more forgettable than others but the soundtrack isn't short of catchy tunes. The story is simple and straight to the point, with some funny dialogue here and there.

I've honestly had more fun with Shovel Knight than I've had with most of the 'AAA cinematic' games that have come out in recent years. Anyone who enjoys platformers and any of the NES games that Shovel Knight takes inspiration from will absolutely love this.

I'd say it's a solid 8/10. By far the best [i]feeling[/i] Borderlands game I've played. The new movement systems with grapple and sliding as well as the overall shooting and gun play are great. The game looks good and runs fairly well on my system but there are stutters every once in a while when a lot is going on. Nothing really out of the ordinary in that regard. 

I think the only place I can knock points off is the story. As I'm sure you've already heard, the main villains aren't the best or most interesting. As of writing, I've completed the main quest line and Moxxi's Heist DLC. I would say the DLC is better than the main quest. It felt more like the older BL games in my opinion. 

Just as a tip if you do decide to buy, wait for a sale and get the Super Deluxe.

To the Moon. Perhaps one of the greatest love stories crafted into a simple point-and-click pixel video game. Don't expect a lot of interaction. You will be an observer, learning about the lifes of Johnny and River.

The writing and story telling is exceptional. Have you seen the movie The Neverending Story? If so, I suppose you remember the scene when Bastian hides in the school's attic to read about the adventures of Atreyu in Fantasia? Try and picture this scene with you sitting at your computer. To the Moon will take possession of you and take you on a journey.

I suggest you play through the game in one session. Takes approximately 5-6 hours. Lock the doors, pull the curtains, mute the phone, get same snacks and be in for a ride (to the moon)!

2055563,381210,Dead by Daylight,37265865,english,"Dead by Daylight is a terrifying and exhilarating game, that allows players to either play as a neglectful and mindful survivor, or as a murderous and fearful killer. Personally, I really enjoy this game, especially as the survivor, as the sensation of fear and having to be aware makes me feel excited. However, this does not mean that I despise to play as the killer, but it does give me pressure and anxiety. This only allows me to play as the killer for couple of matches, but the pressure can be also felt when I play as one of the survivors, since everyone is depending and relying on you (when they are hooked or knocked down). There are many positive aspects to this game that makes it so great, but I also believe there are few features that the developers have to improve on.

Firstly, I have to say that the matchmaking system is just terrible. Most of the time, I have to wait about 10 to 15 minutes, continuously joining and leaving to find a server that has a decent ping. These servers are usually around 200 to 400 ping and it takes even longer to find a good ping match when I am trying to play with my friend. Obviously, people can play with these pings but it would be so much more disadvantageous for the survivors. Therefore, I think the game should construct a setting, where the survivors will be able to adjust the maximum search ping. This way, I would not have to constantly join and leave. I know that this is not the game’s fault and the killer’s server, but still no one would like to play on match where they know that they have a high chance of losing.

Despite the matchmaking system, I really do like the game itself. The idea of silently and carefully fixing generators, juking and trying to escape the killer makes the whole game really thrilling and fun. The maps are also random (unless someone uses an offering), which makes the game more interesting. That moment when you 360 a killer and escape, or when you knock down a survivor as the killer can be really satisfying and exciting. The perks are also really interesting, as players can build their survivors so that it matches their play-style. I really like the idea of teachable perks, because a player might want to only have the perk from another survivor, and use it on a different survivor. For example, my favourite survivor to play is Meg Thomas, and not surprisingly, my favourite perk is “Sprint Burst”. However, I do not like all of Meg’s perks (e.g. Quick and Quiet), and I also really like Claudette Morel’s “Self Care”. This allows me to build up a set up the way I want to, so that I can have different perks on one survivor, and play as it. I do think that every items or perks can be countered with different perks or items. For example, if the survivors have powerful items that gives them an advantage (e.g. Brand New Part), they can be countered by the killer with the perk “Franklin’s Demise”, which makes the survivors drop their items. In other words, I think the game concept is great and everything does fit in a way. 

Recently, I admitted that Dead by Daylight is not a pay to win game, as players cannot buy bloodpoints to upgrade their survivors or collect more items (from the blood web). They have to actually play the game to earn it, and players can collect more by using offerings or completing daily rituals. However, the recent DLCs (Leatherface and Freddy Krueger) has made me consider if this game is a pay to win game or not. Leatherface’s perks, such as “Barbecue and Chilli” can give a huge advantage to the killers and Freddy had to even be nerfed because there were many complaints from the survivors. In other words, the more DLCs a player obtains, the more option and advantage they could possibly have in this game.

Lastly, I have to mention the killers that makes this games absolutely insufferable. The killers that camp and patrol are makes the game extremely difficult for the survivors. I know that the other survivors could simply work on the generators while the killer is camping, but this makes the game for the person hooked unenjoyable and bias. In addition, the players could possibly not complete working on the generators in time (by the time the hooked survivor dies), in which the killer will again hunt. If another survivor is knocked down, this decreases the chance of the other survivors escaping. I should say that the best perk to go against a camping killer would be “Borrowed Time”, but it would not be that difficult for the killer to chase and knock down the survivor again.

In conclusion, I think Dead by Daylight is an incredible game. Despite the horrible matchmaking system and the killers that are “cancerous”, the game provides a sensation of thrill and excitement.",1511499645,1606395525,True,4,2,0.578635036945343,0,True,False,False,76561198296091000,115,3,44008,1066,29960,1610647807

I was sure it'd be enjoyable, but I didn't expect it to be one of the best games I've played in recent memory. The story is absolutely engaging. It's an emotional journey about granting the last wish of an old man, and the way the story is told is remarkable. I can't go too far into detail without spoilers, but I cannot recommend this game enough.

The graphics are done in the old SNES style, with more polish, and look quite nice. The music is beautiful, and is perfect for the scenes that it sets. The game sprinkles humour into the story quite well to add some chuckles to what is a rather sad story. The story itself if beautiful and very well written. There is no other way to put it. I'm a dude, and even then, it was emotionally moving.

[b] Pros: [/b]
[list]
[*] Satisfying gunplay with a satisfactory level of weapons/attachments. It's not Tarkov, but it's servicable.
[*] Good graphics and audio.
[*] Emphasis on tactics. Run and gun won't cut it most of the time.
[*] No hand-holding. This game is very unforgiving and for hardcore shooter fans, this should be a huge positive.

[b] Cons: [/b]
[list]
[*] The community is fucking garbage. Get ready for a non-stop stream of everything offensive that these dude-bros and neckbeards can think of between matches.
[*] A lot of chinese players abusing 500+ ping and then also using thier limited knowledge of english to indulge themselves in some racial slurs between matches.
[*] ""Firefight"" is just a bad game-mode.

[b] TLDR: [/b] If you mute-all and take firefight off your matchmaking list, the game is great. I wavered on whether or not to give this game a recommend.

Complex Review:
What can I say about the Forest? Well I have played this game for 40+ hours and I feel as if I can have a say in this! First of all this isn't like the Stomping Ground, this game came out two years ago and the devs are still releasing amazing updates! I remember the first time I played this, I was like, ""I can't even imagine a better version than this!"", but I didn't realize they had a great team!

Pros:
Great Storyline!
Great Graphics!
Great Building System!
Great Scavaging!
Great Cannibals!

Cons:
There can be a lot of bugs! But the great part is, they release new updates at time fixing more bugs!
For me, I can catch myself getting bored sometimes! But that all depends where you build your base, if you prefer to be attacked more than look for where the cannibals like to hang out! If you like to just build then go out on the back of the island and hide out!

That’s not counting the countless hundred of hours on Civilization 1-4. I love the series, so it pains me to say this: Civilization VI sucks.

The AI is schizophrenic. Settle a city? Denouncement. Don't settle cities? Denouncement. Don't expand your borders? Denouncement. Expand too much? Denouncement. Grow your army to prevent the IA from attacking? Denouncement. Leave your army small? Denouncement.

All this Denouncement eventually leads to the AI to flip out and march to war against you. But if you build a strong military to repel this attack? The AI will focus Science or Religion and win that way.

We'll put it this way - I'm 14 hours deep into Civ VI, playing on the easiest level, the ""I am a Wussie Man Baby! Please don’t hurt me!"" and I have YET TO WIN. This should be a cake walk. I should be curb stomping everyone and everything in arms reach. I should be Brock Lesnar beating up a pack of handicapped preschoolers. And for some reason I just cant make ground.

And the worst part? It took me 14 hours to figure this out. Refund for a fundamentally broken game? Hah. hah, hah. Good luck with that kid.

It's an excellent example a survival-crafting game with a huge space to explore, a wide variety of materials and recipes to locate, and ties everything together with a sci-fi narrative with a touch of horror.

The sound design of Subnautica is excellent. For better or worse, the controls and graphics are reminiscent of Portal 2...which is to say, not bad at all! (But don't expect things to be hyper-detailed either.)

There are a few difficulty levels if you hate the survival mechanics, enjoy the struggle, or like something between. One thing that'll likely be love-it-or-hate-it is how little the game holds your hand. My first death was from not finding water fast enough - I just hadn't learned how to find the supplies yet. If you're aiming to craft certain items, you could have to wait a while - until you stumble across the right blueprint or resource. You can get stuck sometimes, and your only option (without cheating and using a guide) is exploration! I LOVE this approach, but your mileage may vary.

It is a lot of fun and the story, character, and atmosphere are absolutely great, but the gunplay itself is not nearly as satisfying as a lot of other games. It's heavy focus on physics puzzles highlighting the Source engine's abilities also stick out as a dated mechanic. It's great to go back and have a look at what was for its time one of the most innovative games and it is still an enjoyable game to play, but I don't think it is quite as utterly amazing as most of us perhaps think it was. Also, buyer beware, Half-Life 2: Ep. 2 does have something of a cliffhanger ending that has been left hanging since 2007 and in my personal opinion is very unlikely to ever be resolved by any official Valve release. 

However, Project Borealis, which is based on Mark Laidlaw's Epistle 3, may offer some measure of closure to long time Half-Life fans once it does release.

Somepeople say that you are forced to use specfic decks but I disagree. some bosses discourage certain decks (boss that gains strenght when you play a power card) however that does not mean they are unbeat able (I love using power cards I win almost 90% of the times I face him.) The otherpoint against it was no story however that seems to be either changing (they add chracters like the defect which has a small back story that can be built apon)or already there (there is a final final boss after unlocking all the characters and scrafice power for keys that I have not beat).

117135,292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,67373499,english,"It's been 5~6 years since the release of this masterpiece and chances are that you probably already heard how good this game is. And I have to say that all of those comments about the amazing graphics, breathtaking world design, fantastic storytelling with memorable events and exceptional characters are all true. This game is one of the best games ever made and the only excuse you have for not playing it is either not having the time or money. It doesn't matter if you are not a fan of RPG or medieval games, you probably will like this game anyway.

So, since there are literally hundreds of thousands of reviews about this game, with most of them basically saying what I just wrote, I would like to present some other points that I haven't seen in what I've read so far:

First, let's just pause for a second and try to gasp the fact that Geralt was the protagonist of 7 books and 2 games before this one, and this game might be the end of the road for the witcher series.  Do you know how amazing is that? You are not playing with some mediocre protagonist who is just learning his way around the world. You are playing with a professional monster slayer whose story and character have been building up for decades now, and you will define its ending! And don't worry if this is your first contact with the series, because you will be able to catch up with the story and characters fairly easy.

Secondly I want to address the bestiary and the whole monster design/lore. This game has easily the most diversified list of enemies and creatures, with each and every having a well written entry on the bestiary. They bring you not only a detailed niche of the creature, like the way it behaves, how it preys and devours its victims, but also the lore and interesting facts about it. And the game actually follow this information in such a way that you can possibly guess which creature you are hunting before the game tells you. This was the only game that made the extra reading something cool and rewarding. 

Now, this game is not perfect. There are some flaws like the pretty bad UI or the main quest being mostly about finding people and doing favors (seriously, sometimes you have to help a guy for him to help you help another guy for him to tell you where the person you are looking for is - this would be a deal breaker in some games but those persons that you help have such well written backstories and personalities that the whole thing turns out to be exciting.) but for me the worst flaw is the combat and difficulty. 
There's a ton of different bombs, potions and crossbow bolts,  5 signs (magic spells) with a lot of customization and still the most optimal way to fight is to keep pressing B to dodge and spam fast attacks whenever possible. Remember the amazing monster variety that I've just talked about? They are all very similar when fighting and can be killed with the same simple strategy. 

Fortunately the DLCs fixes all of those problems (with the exception of the UI), bringing amazing and fun quests, new character customization that makes other combat strategies more viable and new enemies with different mechanics that force you to use new strategies. 

It's nice to see that CDProjectRED were aware of the game's problems when they made the DLCs. 

Like I said before this game is a must, and if you like the base game (which, let's be honest, you will) then you will enjoy the DLCs even more.",1586964651,1586964695,True,1,0,0.523809552192688,0,True,False,False,76561198090813900,223,16,7105,0,6699,1591456593

But once you play for many hours, you realise there are so many Quality of Life issues that aren't addressed. The dev team is more focused on making more $$ with new DLC content rather than updating the current game to it's best. Bringing me to my next topic.

This is a great little arcade game, but not for the price. I recommend only ever purchasing the base game and the DLC's when it's ON SALE. There is little to no replayability on this game at all. Once you beat the levels, it's done, it's finished. And honestly, it's not a lot of content for the amount of $$ that you spend. Because keep in mind, this game is meant to be played with friends. So they all have to purchase a copy for themselves.

There are no endless stages. It's all about replaying the same exact stage over and over and over again until you get a better score. What do I mean? Well for the base game, there are 6 stages. And in each stage there are about 5-6 levels. That's it. no more. So what do you do now? You've completed the game in like 20 hours. Why can't they just add in 1 Stage, that has infinite levels? I don't know. Oh, I guess you have to spend more money for more levels. Time to buy the DLC.

There are no weekly or even monthly updates to improve or enhance the game.
Okay, IMAGINE THIS: Once you've unlocked all the Chefs/Characters, there are OVER 50! Great! But here's the catch, the ONLY WAY for you to choose which chef to play is by clicking LEFT or RIGHT. So in order to scroll through ALL the chefs that you own, you'll need to click in one direction FIFTY TIMES. There are NO character selection screen where ALL the chefs are displayed on one screen, and you can see all their profile pictures. ""Hey I feel like playing as the green alien today, let me just click right 25 times until I reach it""
Like, that's just one quality of life issue.

After some hours the panic feeling of being chased or the thrill of the hunt kind of goes away and it starts to get that ""playing a game"" feeling though. DBD has events pretty regularly, is always being updated, and also having things added to it. Also, with the connection of the console versions, the game has seen a pretty large boost in players overall. I would recommend it, and if its on sale, you would be silly not to pick it up.

There are islands in the area but the world is more or less completely covered in water as far as the eye can see. Which isn't a bad thing, infact it makes it all the more challenging.

If you are into base building, like I am, this game has a great time with it. Same with resource gathering, survival and vehicles construction.

Ocean exploration involves going to the very depths of dark abyss or burning lava zones to find the resources you need to make the various objects in your base. Creating a on hand recipe book will make gathering easier but nontheless the system is quick so long as you pay attention and set beacons in the appropriateareas to mark places of interest. 

Major resources you will want is Titanium and Quartz as they provide the items that are the basis for base building/shelter creation.

It is imperative you adapt quickly and if you use the survival mode, securing a source of food and fresh water (normally through technological blueprints and fish) is a must if you wish to survive.)

My first play through put me in a rather safe and docile location, no biters, realtively fewStalkers (metal grabbing and aggressive fish almost like a barracuda) and lots of metal and quartz deposits. Along with crash sites with plenty of starter blueprints.

I cannot wait to see what else they add to this game in regards to additional vehicles and base designs.

I found a letter in my mailbox from a man called WIllie who wanted me to go and meet him at the beach.  

So I set off trying to find the beach, only to bump into a very attractive lady called Haley.  I accidently wacked her a few times with my sickle before saying hello.  We talked a little and then I followed her into her house...which she didn't seem to object to but apparently I didn't know her well enough to go into her bedroom.  Fair enough.  I left.  I continued my journey to try and find the beach which was sadly unsuccesful.  It was getting late and darkness fell.   By 1am I still hadn't managed to find my way home and had somehow ended up in the childrens playground! I ran away as fast as I could as I didn't want to residents of Stardew Valley thinking their new neighbour enjoyed hanging out in playgrounds in the middle of the night.  Thankfully I DID find my way back home again and had a long sleep. 

The next morning I decided to head out to try and find this elusive beach....only to end up at the local Joja Supermarket.  I wandered around the isles and then for some unknown reason I held a rock above my head and looked as if I was walking up to people wanting to stone them.  I eventually found how to make the rock go away and left. 

I *still* couldn't find the beach and night fell once more....I purely by accident found myself at the bottom of my garden but needed to hack my way through the undergrowth to get to my house.  By 2am I fell to the ground from exhaustion and passed out.  

The next morning I woke up - NOT in my garden....but in my own bed....which was great...the bad news however was that I appeared to have less money than I did yesterday.  Bugger! I found a hand written letter in my mailbox from a man called Lewis who said he found me on the ground and someone ran off as he approached.  He had carried me to my bed and said he hoped the thief hadn't taken too much money.  Lewis warned that I should be more careful in the future.....(Careful? I was in MY garden! How do I know that YOU 'Lewis' didn't steal my money? And more to the point, why exactly were you wandering around MY garden in the middle of the night? Hmmmm?).  

So this time I decided not to try and find the beach.....and would you believe it, it was the FIRST thing I found (typical).  I met the infamous Willie who gave me a rather nifty fishing rod.  I tested it out.  I caught some seaweed and ate it.  It tasted terrible but game me energy.  Hurrah. 

After an afternoon of fishing I headed home....somehow I ended up back in the playground AGAIN (I know, twice is a little harder to explain...) but thank God I made it back to the farm before night time.  

I watered my vegetables and hit the sack.

I'd keep at it because there's legitimate challenge to be found later in the game but it just doesn't consistently reward successful gameplay enjoyably, interestingly, or often enough to feel worth it. It's also hard for me to call it a real bullet hell. Sure, there's lots of stuff to dodge, but the pace just feels too slow for it to really qualify for me.

Despite every aspect of actual gameplay being beyond mediocore, it's still my favorite game ever made. Explain that to me?

Seriously. On death march the combat is frustrating at best, horribly unbalanced, boring and unengaging, you get less xp and missions and weapons and armor are level locked. 

Exploration is terrible, you can literally buy maps that give you quest markers to the best gear in the game, almost all other loot besides that is randomized so you'll never stumble upon some badass equipment because you already have the map to it and you likely can't use it yet because of level restrictions. 

The story is disjointed and the pacing suffers greatly from the open world design of the game and amount of side content.

If some or many of the things listed here are important for you to enjoy any game, maybe Witcher 3 is not the game for you.


[b]The Combat[/b]

While Witcher 3 is action RPG, some people expect a lot more action from the game. Witcher 3 has no complicated key sequences to memorize so you can pull of really cool combos. While the game provides some extra options to improve the combat (oils, bombs, signs, light or heavy attack, parry, counterattack, dodge) most of these are completely optional. Even on highest difficulty whole game can be played using just simple left mouse click for fast attack, Quen sign for shield and dodging or rolling away when enemy attacks. Everything else can be ignored. You can use all or many of these combat techniques if you want to but you do not have to use them.

The Witcher 3 has no wide variety of weapon types for you to choose from - no guns, poleaxes, two-handed swords, clubs, shields or throwing daggers. You can use crossbow. And you always, ALWAYS, use just one sword, steel sword on humans and silver sword on monsters. That is it.

The combat in general is fairly easy. You should not really die in Witcher 3 if you keep following the quests around your own level, keep upgrading your Witcher gear and do not try to blindly run into fights against enemies much higher level then you. 


[b]Customisation[/b]

In Witcher 3 you play as witcher called Geralt. You can not change the name. You can not pick another profession like mage or barbarion. You can not change your race or gender. Even changing the way Geralt looks is limited to wearing different armors (which WILL change the looks while you run around), having haircut and some optional looks for the beard.

While many side quests in Witcher 3 have several optional endings depending what options you pick, and even main quest have few branching plots where some character may live or die, in the end, the story you follow is set. No matter how many times you play the game, most of the quests and dialogues and events remain same. 

While you find multitude of weapons and armors in Witcher 3, witcher sets are always best so pretty everything else can be sold to the merchants. You are never required to farm some boss for the slight hope of legendary piece.


[b]Grinding[/b]

Witcher 3 has no grinding. If you enjoy killing same random monsters for hours to gather enough xp and gold and eventually level up and unlock new area, this is not the game for you. Monsters you kill provide very little xp and even less when you outlevel them. You get most of xp from doing quests around your current level and finishing main quest line. You can basically ONLY finish main quest and you still level up fast enough. You should do side quests and witcher contracts because they are fun but you are not really forced to finish any of them.

You never need to grind for gold if you explore the world and pick up items hidden in the bags, crates and dead bodies. 

No quest is repeatable. Once finished, they are done. No boss is farmable. Once dead, they do not reappear.


[b]Story and the World[/b]

The world in Witcher 3 is torned by war. In this war there are no good or evil. Most of the people are just trying to survive during this difficult time. There is a lot of mud and dead bodies and monsters eating dead bodies. The world is not happy place full of unicorns (expect 1) and rainbows.

People around you cough, sneeze and fart. If you find these actions revolting and disgusting, you will suffer. A lot. You can not avoid coughing and sneezing and farting around you.

For many quests there are no right or wrong answers. You are given options but none of the options is clearly better or worse. If you pick one path, you will have to kill someone who does not deserve it but if you choose other way someone else will eventually die. 

Young players do not enjoy the story, do not understand the witty remarks and have difficulty understanding pain and suffering some of the actions may cause. This is not the game for kids.

I find reading negative reviews interesting for this game because there are a couple common threads in those--they rate the game poorly and call it ""walking simulator"", but there's a catch: their time played is low. I have a friend who tagged this as walking simulator very early on, but he admitted he never even got far enough to get the first vehicle. I think the only main criticism I would give is that that should have happened sooner because I also found myself wondering what I had gotten into until I got to that point.

Sometimes I like open world games where your actions change things. But I also love when games have a coherent, thoughtful story like this. 

I love some of the ideas behind this and how it's a meaningful story that's about real life, too.

Important: The game is for people with high patience and people who seeks a challenging game to finish. The game is not for the faint of heart. If you want a challenge, then go buy the game. 


If you are familiar with the fromsoftware games, then this would remind you of the thrill you feel of chilling anxiety or frustration fighting a boss that can repeatedly beat you.

The game is beautiful, the art work is really unique in its design comparing it to darksouls or bloodborne. The world is so mesmerizing, the colors bloom every time you get to a new location. When you explore more and more through the game, you will experience the obscure conditions of the characters or things revolving around the world. The game is really difficult if you are not good with the controller or the souls game mechanics, though the game utilizes new features like jumping or the grappling hook. The game still feels like its old predecessors but with new welcomed traits. 

The combat is very strategic, you cannot just attack and dodge or roll like dark souls. There are less instances where I felt like I could cheat my way into situations. I couldn't really spam arrows or magic, etc. You need to learn how to time your deflections/parry and destroy your enemy's posture to win an engagement. The fights become so intense sometimes, and it feels so good. One mistake can lead you dying, even with a resurrection, I was hesitant to die because of maybe some consequences. Stealth feature is also welcomed in the game, it is fairly new in the fromsoftware games, but it does help a lot in some cases. I could not stress enough how being smart in an engagement saved me a lot of times from dying. I have to add that, there are instances where I felt like I had an edge against the game because of my knowledge of the darksouls and bloorborne games, there are times where I knew things like a hidden wall, or a hidden object, I was really thorough in playing the game because of my history with this franchise. I would like to advise people to just read a lot of the hints, and inventory items to completely grasp the whole game.

The story is okay, I wouldn't say it is the best, but it did keep me interested, it is much easier to understand compared to the story of its predecessors. You are a shinobi tasked to help the divine heir, it's pretty straight forward before you progress the game. The more you progress, the more the story becomes complex and interesting. You will need to read a lot of notes, or talk and listen carefully to the NPC's to have a better understanding of everything. It is easy to miss a few side stories or quests if you make mistakes. In the end I didn't feel that much for the story itself,I only felt a lot of relief that I managed to beat the game. That is not because the story is bad, but because the game punished me so much with the boss fights, and by the end of the game I just wanted to finish it so I could feel satisfied. The game rewards the player for their dedication of getting better in the game and outsmarting it to have an advantage. I would like to add that there are annoying boss fights that are super difficult to defeat, some took me hours to complete. Even so, at the end, I felt the joy of success after finally beating them. 

The sound and music is pretty solid like the rest of fromsoftware games, the sound is pretty grounded. The swords clashing feels so impactful everytime it deflects, the blood splatters everytime I slice an enemy. I can feel the thrill of just trying to not be hit, desperately trying to break the enemy's posture then doing the final death blow. The music does its job, it is not over the top, but it does the job. The voice acting is mysterious and a bit like the darksouls or bloodborne games, but the NPC's doesn't feel like they are crazy or looney. The more the player listens to the characters, the more the player gets an idea of who they are and who they were. Again, the game doesn't spoon feed the player all the information, the player needs to find it for themselves. 

The AI felt a little stupid sometimes, the guards are sometimes literally stupid. Let me explain, once you kill a guard, the corpse will remain on the ground, but the other guards wouldn't care if there are piles of bodies laying on the ground. They would only react if they see you, and if the other guards alert them as well. The AI is good, when you start fighting against them, they have different set of moves to counter what you do. There are bosses where if you side step on their first attack, they would do a sweep, but if you stay in front of them, they would go for a thrust attack. Little things like that should be taken into account. It is important to mention that, some of the bosses were so creative. Some were really nerve wracking because of their appearance, backstory or just the uncanny sound they mark. Those little things made the game so special every different boss encounter.

SUMMING IT UP: If you like challenging, gritty action packed games, then go buy. Who doesn't wanna be a ninja assassin? In the end I did enjoy the time. I had a very stressful time handling some of the bosses, but after successfully beating them after my 45 hours of playthrough, I felt so accomplished as if I received an award at the oscars. It was a fun time for me, but in the end, “git gud” is the key to finish the game. 

Note: If you like character creation or varied build types or races. Then you wouldn't find that here, this may not be for you. Its variation is how you handle your enemies, your strategy and critical thinking.",1564207378,1564207830,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198064929200,79,1,2867,0,2744,1578054446

Singleplayer

War between Mars and Earth, Humans vs Humans in a war for territory and resources. Missions take place at beautiful places and landscapes. All the characters are likable and enjoyable. Story and the plot are gripping and amusing. It's well told and presented. 10/10
Apart from the regular missions there are also Jackal side missions. You get to fly your own spaceship and battle others. It's fun and refreshing. 
There is a new difficulty called Specialist, it's simular to Veteran with just one difference, no auto healing. You have to find healing items and use them carefully because there is a limited amount of them. It's a nice challenge I recommend to everyone. 

Multiplayer

It feels like Black Ops 3 with different maps, guns and operators. It is fun and if you enjoyed BO3 you'll enjoy this one too.

Zombies

I didn't really play this mode that much. Just wasn't that interesting to me, so I won't write anything about it.

Ignoring my biased against the From Software sub-genre they have created. 

I had zero technical issues.

The last nail in the coffin: Most games increase difficulty by simply adding HP and not adding capabilities to the enemies. Sekiro tries to side step this by giving the player more capabilities to deal with tougher enemies. This is unfortunately all undermined by the non-linear ""exploration"" the game ""offers"". I put quotes there because none of the ""exploration"" is opt-in. In other words, you never know you are exploring until you find yourself against three bosses that you have no chance to defeat because you went left instead of right three hours ago. There is also no indication that you are participating in optional content.

Some might say ""google it"", but this isn't a min/max loot shooter or complex simulation game. This is an experience game, and as soon as you have to ""google"" something in an experience game, the experience is broken.

I'm so sad that I have to leave this game, but it's just frustrating. Many other reviews have gone over the ridiculous broken balance of this game towards op survivors (read them if you want the technical aspect), so I'll just make a metaphor so you can understand how it feels.

Remember school? Remember that group of kids who used to pick on the ""different"" kid, physically abuse him and/or name-call him? Remember he couldn't defend himself because they were more and he was weaker than any of them? Remember how the one time he defended himself he got caught by the teachers and got suspended by the principal and the kids that picked on him didn't suffer any consequences?

School is the game. The group of kids are the survivors. The ""different"" kid is the killer. The abuse is just the broken gameplay that always favours survivors. The name-calling is the end of the match chat whenever you have to use cheap strategies because you have no other choice if you want to rank up. The killer is weaker than just one of the survivors, and there are 4. The time they defended was when they asked for better balances. The suspension were buffs to survivors and nerfs to the killers. The principal is the devs.

TLDR: If you like winning easy, buy the game and play survivor.
Otherwise, don't bother. The game is not and will probably never be fun again for killers.",1518897454,1518897454,False,13,4,0.617887139320374,3,True,False,False,76561198025380400,185,1,39098,0,6563,1574638147

3053461,621060,PC Building Simulator,41099322,english,"After playing this game for a fair amount of time today being it's launch, Ive found some good and some bad to bring out. I'll list some of the things that may need adressing aswell as some of the good features about this game. Alongside that I will make a few suggestions towards the game.
Pros:
- Large amount of selection for cases, brands and types of parts available
- Career mode to work at
- Realistic steps (while starting out the game) to build and change parts of a PC
- Very good for people getting into building PC's, goes through a well formatted tutorial
- Good for people looking to learn more about PC's in general
- Realistic looking parts, good modelling 

Cons (Aswell as bugs):
- Obvious visual bugs that need addressing
- Interior cables come through the outside of cases in some cases
- Parts of a PC may become glitched outside of the case (such as fans)
- (Might be just me) The refresh rate is not changeable from 59Hz
- No anti-aliasing to the game so some things look quite choppy
- Lack of certain realistic sounds (such as walking, box opening)
- Annoying fan sound from PC
- Lack of cable managing customization
- Movement is very slow and field of view is not changeable

Recommendations:
I would recommend for the developers to put a bit more emphasis into graphics. I understand the game is a simulator and not really meant for graphics and visuals, yet I think it would benefit very muh and would be a step in the right direction for being worth is price of $20 (CAD) currently. Another thing would be more customizeability for the game itself, possibly such as the field of view in game. I would like to see (and most likely along with alot of other people) more animations. These could possibly include a box opening animation for the PCs, a delivery animation, maybe for even placing items on the workbench. Also adding a few more smooth animations for the operating system within the game would boost the overall smoothness of the game, I believe. Another aspect that could be improved upon is the cable management within the computers. If there was more customizeability for where the cables will route through it would add ALOT to the game itself with attention to detail. Also, a big recommendation would be possibly the addition of a mode or option to have a more advanced experience, for users who know about building computers with much knowledge. Possibly getting rid of guidelines in this mode and to maybe also require the user to select the correct headers for each cable connecting to the motherboard (or PSU). Another big aspect that could be improved upon is water cooling. I very strongly believe if watercooling was added that this itself would make the game worth its price. Adding AIOs to the game would make it much more customizeable and alot more interesting. Maybe even in the long run adding custom loops too! Overall, there is much to be said about the game and I do believe there is alot of potential for upgrading this game as it is of course in early access right now. At the moment, I am recommending the game for beginners to PC building and because it is in early access and there is still alot to be improved upon.

I've played a couple rounds with friends smashing the starter decks together, a few casual drafts and a keeper draft. That put me at the ~9 hour mark and so far, so good. I've really been enjoying myself. Been quite some time since a new CCGs mechanical systems have given me stiff nips. I think the last two that have made me sit up and take notice would be Shadowfist and Middle Earth: The Wizards back in 1995. Now, I am definetly still in the honeymoon phase; whether this one will be as deep and maintain the same long lasting interest as the former two I mentioned (I still play 'em) remains to be seen and too early for me to objectively tell. I have no issues with the monitization model because it comes the closest to the real world model while allowing me to break the rules in one signifigant regard. I see a card I want for a deck I buy it. That's it. I don't want to churn daily quests or grind games for hours to get my cards ""for free."" I already have a job. I sold a rare from my keeper draft for ~$5 and bought a couple dozen cards to modify my starter decks with for a about nickle to a dime, each. Other games where you bust up your cards into cookie dust or fairy sprinkles or whatever the return rate is booty sweat. Finally, I can play phantom drafts (no retention of drafted cards) for _free_. I'm about to make my $20 bucks sit up and dance for me in a way that cannot be equalled by nearly all competitors, to date. Magic: The Gathering Online has a singles market but no free draft so nuts to that.

That being said, I can recommend a purchase for aficionados of the genre and an encouragement for the curious with spare holiday dukats to step on board. If you think your in the later camp make damn sure to not accept the event tickets and boosters that come with the account or no within-two-hours return is possible (to quote Surly Joe, ""You seen 'em; you play 'em."")

[h1]First of all: 10/10! Recommended![/h1]
(Have I ever rated a game that high?) ^^

Nevertheless - this game has done so many things in the right way during the development like with the game design that it's hard to find something they have done in a wrong way.

The feeling during the gameplay is gorgeous at all. (At least you need a PC that has a sound grasp of contemporary developments.) You get that fast hooked on this game, that's unbelievable.

Pros:
+ you'll never encounter any moment where you are NOT feeling to be on or in a water world
+ learning curve is smooth
+ exploration everywhere
+ all that more you go further into the deep or progress in the story, all that more fear you'll get
+ great concept of crafting and upgrading (every station that crafs or upgrades fits in its role)
+ no resource or recipe is useless
+ sea life - they are all well planned and placed (I mean they have even elaborated the evolution of certain species.)
+ the world is HUGE!- well designed biomes, caves, rifts, wracks
+ animations - they are all smoothed rendered that you are always have a flow
+ sounds - music is calm and not very present (thats's good), the sfxs' are superb
+ story - consists of fragments of voice logs you find during your progress through the game (This is by far not Witcher 3 story telling, but the way they've chosen it suits the game.)
+ it will leave early acces this quarter and gives the players exactly what the devs promised at the beginning of the development
+ free saving (no autosave)
+ high replayability

Cons:
- Sometimes you encounter some [i]little[/i] ""bugs"" like:
- getting stuck with the Prawn Suit (Getting stuck with my Prawn Suit was more or less my failure, I wanted to walk through a hole which was obviously to small for me. ^^ So never try this on your own. ;) It was just at the beginning of a new exploration so I reload the save and everything was fine. :D So make a save everytime you start a new exploration.)
- a locker won't display its inventory but the opening animation started. (That only happens if you are ""to far away"" from the locker - there is some miscalculation between the hitboxes.)
- from time to time your base is flooded, but only as animation - the hull is still intact. (Just save and reload and your base is fine again.)
(- no autosave: you have to remind youself to back you up )

[i]After 20h+ ingame I encountered no other bugs in the lastest version of Subnautica.[/i] The bugs I encountered in the previous 40h+ ingame of the old versions are all fixed now. Like the overall performance of the game - there is [u]no[/u] stuttering during biome loads [u]anymore[/u], there are [u]no[/u] game closing errors [u]anymore[/u], etc.
